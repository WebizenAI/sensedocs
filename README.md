# Sense Docs

Firstly - this is just initialised, there's a bunch of old docs; and not much in-terms of the new stuff that the docs were set-up to provide.  

NOTE: i've also set-up [Docs.HumanCentricAI.org](http://docs.humancentricai.org/) which is in-turn set-up with a Discord 

Group: Here's [The Link](https://discord.gg/aRTzYX9QY4) 

Sense is about producing a information networking fabric that is used to support a complex language model, that's in-turn employed for various foundational applications.  

The objective is to seek to ensure that when a natural agent (person) is engaged in an activity via voice or text (reading / writing materials); that the content is able to be parsed using complex natural language processing, but that it does not need to be shared with any other agent in-order to provide the facility to do so.  In-turn, the implication becomes a need to figure out how to define the broader Permissive Commons Systems; of which, this becomes a foundational part of it.   The 'sense' work, is an instrumental foundation for HumanCentricAI, whether it be employed via Webizen like systems or via alternatives.

Generally speaking;

1. [[IntroductoryNotes]] - provides basic introductory information that relates to the sense project.   This is the starting-point for the work on sense.  
2. [[PCT-Webizen-Notes]] is a bunch of old docs, many of which are likely to be outdated or subsequently updated via the [Webizen DevDocs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/) - but some of that content may end-up being reused as useful notes about the structure of how to produce these sense systems.
3. [[WebScience]] is intended to be a folder where the philosphical 'web science' stuff goes, that isn't actually about implementation specifically; rather, about various tech-social factors.

More will be produced overtime. this is just the beginning... :) 


## introduction

Work is underway to produce systems that have been broadly termed Webizen.  The dev-docs for webizen also incorporate some information about a related dependency called Permissive Commons.   Whilst doing the R&D to implement these systems, the complexities involved in seeking to properly define the AI Enabled Human Centric; Vocabulary systems, and related systems requirements; led me to starting a new documentation site to better structure thoughts, requirements, considerations and all such related notes, facets, deliberations, components, etc.. 

Basically; its a fairly difficult thing to do well, and it appears that the implications of attempting to do so brings about an array of highly sophistocated challenges. So, i thought it best to write more about it, as i go about doing the work to implement something functional in working software, etc.

I just came-up with the name sense, i thought it was a good name for it.  The Ai Agents that are plugged into my systems are constantly telling me that its about a model; when i don't really see it that way, nor do i think that the system for better supporting the employment of language with AI agents - is the same sort of thing like ChatGPT or other systems that are called 'language models', when they appear more to be a form of 'knowledge model'; and often, its not very good with understanding the language it professes to be developed to do.

In anycase;

The purpose of this project is to use advanced, modern techniques to develop a language model that will be firstly focused upon defining to the best of our ability, the english language, in an extensible way; that can then be developed further by others to better support other languages.  Languages are fundamentally social things, its a foundational part of how we organise our means to communicate, and is a foundational pillar for how we organise anything socially and in-turn also, an integrally useful artiface associated to and/or weith consciousness, as is able to be processed by observers. 

The video by Json Silva about Ontological Design, may usefully simplify the concept.

Now therefore; the objective purpose is to define a system that'll be implemented as (working software); that will in-turn be integrally employed to construct other webizen related systems.  Foundationally, these systems support the production of top-level ontology.

the [[PCT-Webizen-Notes]] provides some legacy notes; which, as is noted, is better found / reviewed via the [Webizen Dev Docs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/).


### Licensing Notes

Until noted otherwise, any original work is presently unlicensed; and contributions are subject to the [Webizen Terms](https://devdocs.webizen.org/GuideForDevelopers/WebizenTerms/) as is outlined in that and related linked documents.

3rd party works are provided via whatever license applies to those works.  

The works done by me are sought to be licensed via a methodology that's basically about supporting human rights.  This in-turn requires a means to support [[LicensingFrameworks]] (supported by the [[ValuesProject]] and related [[ValuesCredentials]] ); to both [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] whilst also (consequentially) empowering means to end-up providing licensing in a manner that has an array of express purposes, including but not limited to protecting [[FreedomofThought]] without degrading the good purpose of any such forms of agreements.  

Until this is better define / resolved My Work is not licensed for any commercial purposes; and, all rights are reserved.  This is not intended to be contrary to the interests of [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] or in-turn also [[HumanCentricAI]] rather; that i note, i've been subjected to alot of very hostile (bad) actors, often they've suggested they've been 'doing it all already' - yet here we are, some 22+ years down the track and nope, the means to support the human rights of ordinary persons to make use of their information to support their rights, to support peace; its not been delivered by any such persons anywhere on earth.

Hopefully, an option for those who seek something like this, may be brought about; but it won't be made able to work properly (ie: #RealityCheckTech ) unless its done in a manner that addresses the sorts of issues described by the [[SafetyProtocols]] notes, etc..

For more information on the work being done to achieve this, please note the [Webizen Dev Docs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/) and related project. 

As noted; if you'd like any further clarification let me know.
