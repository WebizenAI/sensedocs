The most well-known variants are operating globally.  What does not exist today, is HumanCentricAI & related SocioSphereAI requirements to support HumanCentricAI.   Whilst there are alot of building-blocks that require implementation in a particular and therefore specified manner; one of the issues that is considered difficult to address, is that the complexity of the models required to support high-quality AI inferencing solutions, are presently very large.  The consequence of this is that they're only able to operate on systems that have much more resources available than is reasonably considered available for 'home users' or in other words, natural persons in their private capacity; or in other words, means to support Human Centric AI. \n\nThe implication of Human Centric AI; does not replace other forms of AI systems; rather, the intended purpose is to provide grounding for the development of societal systems that will in-turn grow to become dependant upon the use of AI in a way that is akin to electricity. \n\nAs such; the complex problem that this note is seeking to illustrate, is about the methods through which it MAY be possible, to develop a solution that supports the ability for users to stream AI 'models' or 'packages' to systems that they control; and are privately employable for the user.  In-turn also, how these systems may in-turn also support, the ability to share and operate on a permissive basis, throughout and between communities; based upon attributes and other discriminating factors.  Noting, this is intended to be about empowerment, rather than harms or discrimination, etc; but therein, the rules about why and how these sorts of functions are achieved, become instrumental to the development of systems that are equipped to achieve any sort of materially protective & positive set of goals.\n\n## Design Challenges & Considerations\n\nAs noted at the start of this document; there's a challenge about how to form useful software that doesn't require an individual to be 'wired into' the broader global 'cloud' 'hive-mind'. \n\n### Notes about Requirements\n\nThere are several 'langauge models' that exist; and have been produced in various formats.  There are differences between the models that exist, and the ability to produce a 'model' (dislike that term, but anyhow) that better takes into consideration various complexities, that are linked with spatio-temporal, sociology factors that often thereafter invokes factors that relate to other languages; whether written or pictorial, results in a complex series of inputs.\n\nFurthermore; as it is said, 'history is told by the winner', which is a material factor that has various implications; that may profoundly determine, that the popular belief about the provonance or meaning of a concept, may not be the accurate objective description of it, but rather a common-place subjective opinion, or objective association of the use of a word or phrase in a particular social spatio-temporal context.  \n\nAn Personal AI agent; should ideally be equipped to support the means to inform the human user of circumstances where the use of particular language in a particular way, may have unintended consequences due to differences between persons and/or groups, in association to the use of any such language.  \n\nThen the extension that is built upon defining an appropriate language AI process (sense) for Human Centric AI (ie: Webizen); thereafter, has an impact on how it is in-turn used by anything that is built on-top of it; and/or, in a manner that makes use of it as a dependency.\n\nIn seeking to figure out how to form a model that supports both the independent and personal and thereafter - use with communities, i've started writing this note... \n\nIt is going to be important to also consider how to support maintainence of the tooling, alongside hygiene and various other factors. \n\n### Compression\n\nThe use of techniques to reduce the size of the files and programs is central to the methods considerations.  These considerations are broader than simply transport related compression methodologies.  The coding schema should consider how techniques that have the effect of reducing the code-base might be effectively applied.  If the code-base is able to assume a degree of existing or predicate information exists within the database, this may be in-turn employed in a manner that reduces both the filesizes and the amount of memory that's used; but, the implications with respect to the processing costs, are something to be considered.\n\nThere's a question about whether and how unique identifiers might be created which have the result of significantly reducing the size of queries otherwise associated with the texts.\n\nQuestion becomes; whether and how look-up tables might be used; and/or how they may already be in use via underlying software.\n\nCompression doesn't matter so much if the model is relatively small and used rarely; however, when the opposite is the case, there's an array of important benefits.\n\n### Decentralised Cryptography Considerations\n\nThere's an array of factors that would benefit from ensuring the methods take into account the idea that there are decentralised and federated schemas in use; in addition to version control related considerations.  The version control issues, end-up being part of the temporal solutions, as changes must occur overtime; rather than simultaniously. \n\nYet, when there is an assumption that a record is the same as is intended; then, there should be some way of verifying / validating that the assumption is correct.\n\nAnother issue that is quite important; is to ensure that there are strong cryptographically enhances measures to control the use of the Networked AI components by human agents.\n\nThis will in-turn require an array of 'safety protocols' that seek to expressly state what the intended characteristics are and what conditions may present an alarm and/or stop process.\n\n### Theory linked considerations.\n\nWorkflow concepts.\n\nUser has basic app installed. \nApp has a database capability. \nApp has a capacity to run models somehow.\nmodels are defined as components. \n\nModels evolve overtime using 'spare' computational capacity.\n\nApp has command set for pulling resources from the web in parts from nodes across the network.  \n\nLinked Considerations: \n\nSETI - the Seti App distributed processing across various nodes.  \n\n\n\n\n","excerpt":"This note provides a
