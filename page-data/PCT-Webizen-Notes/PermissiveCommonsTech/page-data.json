The ability to decentralise the use of the information artifacts.\n2. The ability to independently assert read, append, write and delete permissions to different agents based on the context of the information category / type / stakeholder framework.\n3. The ability to support [[TemporalSemantics]] (inclusive to version control)\n4. The ability to make use of different types of protocols, depending on the needs of the producer of the permissive commons assets / content. \n5. The ability to make notations in RDF (linked data) that can point to a particular version of an artifact; and a protocol method that can support the discovery and use of that particular version, even if the original publisher no-longer makes that data available themselves (pending types / methods, etc.)\n6. The ability to support 'rules' about content management (read / append) in a way that is different to read permissions. \n7. The ability to support privacy (/ human dignity).\n\nLinked-Data Ontologies are often difficult to find online, all too often the original location of the namespace has moved or is no-longer available.  As semantic web systems are built using namespaces that are pointed at a particular location where the description of that ontology is intended to exist; when the links become broken, the consequences have a network effect.\n\nWeb 2.0 APIs provide information, whether it be permissioned or public; yet, this method requires users to make specified queries for the information they're looking for at the time of the query; which has an array of privacy implications in addition to the problems noted in relation to the linked-data ontology space issues.\n\nThe concept of 'commons' basically refers to some kind of 'group'.  It could refer to a group of people who live in a particular juristiction, whose governments publish their legislation in a permissive commons format; that provides others the ability to refer to the specific law that existed at a specific time in relation to a contract or other document relating to law is intended to be associated with; in this case, the general public have no ability to modify the records, but they are able to read / consume the records with their Local AI agent. \n\nAnother form of permissive commons may be an array of information about biosphere related things (ie: like wikipedia related assets) or machine learning models; or indeed also, works that relate to a group project, that leads to an ability to support different sorts of business models (note: [[ValueAccountingInitiatives]] ). \n\nThe concept of [[Ontologies]] is fairly important to understand; noting, one of the greatest purposes of Permissive Commons, is to support means to decentralise 'group' ontologies (is is distinct to personal ontologies). \n\nThe Development Folder for ontology related work is currently located [here on github](https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023) \n\n\n","excerpt":"Permissive Commons Tech Permissive Commons is thought of as a form of technology, given the requirement for a specification to be defined i…","outboundReferences":[{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"h1\", {\n    \"id\": \"temporal-semantics\"\n  }, \"Temporal Semantics\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Temporal semantics is a branch of semantics that deals with the study of time and its relation to language and meaning.
