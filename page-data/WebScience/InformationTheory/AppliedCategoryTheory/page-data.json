Therein, there's not really any such things as `disinformation` rather its misclassified information.\n\nThese sorts of semantics define the difference between `knowledge` systems vs. `information` systems; as are otherwise illustrated by the image provided below;\n\n![[Diagram8.jpg]]\n\nThis diagram is intended to be intepreted by starting at the consciousness point; whereby there is then a choice about whether to create `knowledge systems` or `information systems` and this choice leads to consequential implications.  \n\nAs such, the webizen environment seeks to employ ontologies that are able to be used within documents to declare the intended characteristics of various elements within artifacts.   This is in-turn intended also to be foundationally employable via [[TemporalSemantics]] that are intended to support the causal process through which new or unpopular concepts may be subject to attacks, but then later found to be accurate.  the distinction becomes; defining what the author / human agent / agent intended the document to state; and how they may in-turn be judged in connection to those statements overtime.
