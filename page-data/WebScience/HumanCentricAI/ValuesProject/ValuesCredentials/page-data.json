Values credentials are a type of [VerifiableClaims&Credentials](VerifiableClaims&Credentials.md).\n\nThe term 'values' is intended to denote the concept of a persons (human being or guardian) 'human values' that need to be provided the apparatus to provide support for those values.\n\nThese tools, are considered to be of instrumental importance for the development of webizen as 'peace infrastructure' both as a project, and as a toolset for the production of other projects.\n\nThe Values Credentials, provide support for how other agents are able to be managed.  Rather than the concept of 'opt-in' or 'consent', the concept of 'values credentials' relates to 'human agency', and the ability and desirability for human beings as foundationally important active natural agents, to make wilful choices about how it is they want to organise their life; and in-turn also, how it is they're able to track and improve their own quality of being, and the growth of themselves as a person.  \n\nUsers are able to use values credentials, to help them curate how they interact with other agents; and can even provide support for excluding themselves from other agents who do not share some particular common-value that is of great importance to that person / agent.\n\nImportantly also, these systems are designed to support [[SocialFactors]] ,

exist.  The future [[TheValuesProject]] outcome is prodominately designed to provide the software required for people to more respectfully engage in contracts with others online directly between one another; and in-turn, they are also able to vary their agreements and make their own independent decisions about what to do in circumstances where values have been breached.  To enable these systems, more work needs to be done during this development stage.  As such, the ability to engender agency for persons in a manner that is considered [[FitForPurpose]] is not able to be better achieved until the technology that furnishes the means to do so, has been successfully accumplished. As such, the notes about the present-development stage is of instrumental importance until it is otherwise declared.\n\n#### The present development stage\n\n[[TemporalSemantics]] are kinda useful, so i'll make a note as of the time that i am now therefore writing this note. These notes will be updated overtime, and the information will be supplimented rather than replaced - save exceptional circumstances, etc.\n\n##### 3rd Feb 2023: notes\n\nPursuant to the notes made in the [[GuideForDevelopers]] and related [[WebizenTerms]] which is now therefore being developed primarily to support the [[WebizenDiscord]] channel; where there are conflicting values that are otherwise noted in one or more of the values related instruments noted above; a degree of [[BestEfforts]] to form a common-sense opinion / position, is overwhelmingly considered desirable.  IF persons are unable to bind themselves to the general concepts that are emboided in these instruments, then do not get involved.  Persons who are known to have wilfully acted in a manner that has sought to commit wrongs such as those described by the notes on [[SocialAttackVectors]] may be subject to [[banishmentExile]] without notice and without further regard, irraspective of employer or any other factor that may otherwise discriminatorily fail to adhere to the foundational principals described in the instruments above.  \n\n#### Once webizen systems are operational.\n\n### Arbitration of conflicting values.\n\nThe arbitration of matters involving alledged wrongs will be processed in accordance with the [[WebizenTerms]] stipulations; until such time as [[TheWebizenCharter]] and corralated [[WebizenAlliance]] infrastructure is able to be established; which in-turn requires a functional [[WebizenTechStack]] implementation, which is the purposeful activity that gives rise to the purpose of having written this and other notes here. \n\n[[BestEfforts]] are to be undertaken at all times, however, all rights are reserved.\n\n`#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols`","excerpt":"Values Credentials Values Credentials are electronic instruments that can be used to support various types of relationships with other enti…","outboundReferences":[{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"h1\", {\n    \"id\": \"temporal-semantics\"\n  }, \"Temporal Semantics\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Temporal semantics is a branch of semantics that deals with the study of time and its relation to language and meaning.
