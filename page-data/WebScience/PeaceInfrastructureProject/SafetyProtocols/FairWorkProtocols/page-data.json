For example:\n\n1.  Social criteria: Developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers could be considered a social issue, as it relates to the well-being and rights of workers. Ensuring that knowledge workers are treated fairly and are able to work in a supportive and healthy environment could be seen as a key element of a company's social responsibility.\n    \n2.  Governance criteria: Fair work protocols can also be related to governance criteria, as they can help to ensure that a company is governed in a transparent and accountable manner. Developing and implementing fair work protocols can help to demonstrate a company's commitment to responsible and ethical business practices.\n    \n\nOverall, ESG criteria can be related to the importance of developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers in that they can help to ensure that companies are addressing key social and governance issues and are committed to responsible and ethical business practices.
