The ability to understand the meaning of english words, isn't simply able to be done as well as may otherwise be formed - should the history of those words be considered or be made able to be considered.\n\n#### Specialised Vocabularies & Field Specific Meanings\n\nThere are various industries that make use of language of various forms and in various ways.  \n\nSometimes the meaning that is applied within that professional field; has distinctions to the use of the term in other settings.  As such, the concept topic-field becomes an important attribute when seeking to comprehend the 'meaning' of a statement, that may be employed in relation to a specified field of '[liberal arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education)' profession, skillset or domain. \n\n#### Functional (Software) Language\n\nLanguage sets for the useful production of software, may include definitions about protocols and in-turn also API definitions.   Further definitions could be provided about the meaning of various functions provided by various software languages.  \n\n#### Translations\nA 'gold plated' solution would also be able to support translations between languages with a high-level of accuracy, in real-time. \n\n#### Complex Document \"Graph\" support for AnyURI\n\nA gold plated solution might be able to process the text (or indeed also audio) of any webpage or electronic resource, and support a means to both better manage the history of a persons time spent on a computer, supporting improved recall and perhaps also the ability to archive versions of documents and thereafter support the ability to distinguish between versions of the same resource that may either change; or that the context relating to the content artifact changes, as to result in a different sort of meaning / categorisation of the content artifact; and in-turn perhaps also, any other content artifacts that refer to it.\n\n### SocioEconomic Considerations.\n\nThere is an incredibly high-skilled series of 'jobs' or in-other-words, work, that does continually need to be undertaken and the useful benefit of that work is instrumental. \n\nAs is noted below; there are some solutions that are available as 'open source libraries' yet there are other solutions that are made available on a paid basis.   Given the enormous scope of works that could be done towards supporting the commons / common-sense of computer-humanity language systems, whilst the means to make use of these systems should be free of 'survellience' particularly in relation to private use, the idea that all this work can be done 'for free', isn't considered reasonable or consistant with various practical factors that have a firm footing in reality.  As such, some way of ensuring support for those whose job/skillset/life it is to do language related work, is considered both reasonable and important.  \n\n### Defining AI Related Input.\n\nAs is noted in the [[AgentLabelling]] note; it is important that the technical delivery is designed in such a way that ensures that, by default, the solution identifies which agent was responsible for which words being added to a document or communication artifact or event; This is likely able to be done via markup that is embedded in the content assets, however the exact solution is presently unknown and yet to be more formerally defined.  Whilst part of the consideration relates more specifically to AI (inc 'autocorrect') the same requirement is usefully important for collaborative documents involving many human actors.\n\n### Summary: *\"Gold Plated Solution\"* \n\nWhilst these considerations are not yet exhaustive (ie: there's more), and that i have not got into the database (software) methods and implications - as yet... i note again,\n\nIt is not presently expected that all of these sorts of qualities are going to be achievable nor is it considered that these qualities, characteristics and related considerations are all required in-order to make a significant improvement above and beyond the manner through which systems are made to operate today.  \n\n\n","excerpt":"English Language Modelling This Document is a work in progress!
