This could be coupled with stronger labor protections and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that workers are not exploited.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that should be avoided in order to end digital slavery, including:\n\n1.  Exploitative working conditions: Employers should ensure that workers are not subjected to excessive or unreasonable workloads, and that they are provided with fair pay and benefits.\n    \n2.  Forced labor: Employers should not use threats, intimidation, or coercion to force workers to perform labor against their will.\n    \n3.
