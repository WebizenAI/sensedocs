Some relate to the intended application model, others relate to the broader nature of the fundamental concept - regardless of how its implemented.  Both are important. \n\nThe functional requirement is to produce a natural language system that is able to be operated on a smart phone or similar sort of IoT device; alongside personal computers (laptops, desktops, etc.).  The processing of words should be done locally, although the system may get 'programs' that provide additional functionality that is not otherwise available locally.  This mechanism is not intended to interfere with privacy in any way; at least, not any meaningful way...  \n\nThere are multiple parts to this challenge.  some of the first parts of the challenge; is to, \n\n1. define the data-structure for the systems.  \n2. define an 'ai program streaming' system, that enables local use with limited hardware resources that is extensible. this is thought to relate to both the structure and packaging method for 'programs', and has broader implications beyond the language / vocab model.\n3. understanding the theory; whether it is in-effect innovative and new theory, or entirely the discovery of older theorem\n4. Provide a comprehensible explaination of the considerations; which relate to various fields.\n5. Seek collaboration and engagement to cooperatively produce a fit-for-purpose outcome, respectfully, with others - if possible.  This is often difficult in areas that involve many different disciplines of expertise; involving exceptional minds, that are always balanced.\n\nThe model should be able to be trained to be able to be used in a variety of contexts, including but not limited to:\n\n   - Dictionary and Spellcheck\n   - Ontology Production\n   * Ontology Reasoning\n   * Search\n   * Database Queries\n   * Database Structures\n   * Content Metadata Generation\n   * Ai Assistants\n   * API Generation\n   * Sense; 'meaning intepretation', and assistance.\n\n### Components\n\nThere's a variety of identified components.  \n\n**Spatio-temporal**\nThe role of spatio-temporal context, is considered to be incredibly important.  There are various reasons for this; which will be described in further detail within the functional design notes. \n\n**Image Processing** \nThere is a need to be able to perform an array of image processing techniques, using opencv and/or similar and/or alternatives not well known to me yet, at least not mindfully atm. These image processing tasks need to be applied upon image based vocabulary, alphabets and image based objects; as is noted by [[Heraldry]] but is not exclusively. \n\n**Vocabulary charts**\nbest term i can come-up with for the concept atm.  The concept of a vocabulary is one part of a broader chart, which ends-up being woven into the spatio-temporal ecosystems, that in-turn employ the resources produced via image processing. \n\n**Phonetics**\nBuilding a phonetic or spoken words / speech library, is considered to be at another level.  there is existing phonetic datasets that are able to assist with this task; but, it is not presently considered to be a priority to deploy, but rather, a point of importance to ensure the ability to provide deployment support, at some later stage.  It should therefore be part of the design paradigm. \n\n## Methods\n\nThere's many levels to this thing / task / activity.  Some relates to philophical considerations, and the structure of knowledge; others, relate to physics and the methods of computation. \n\n### Objective\n\nWhy is this so hard..??  when i could just use [WordsAPI](wordsapi.com) and get the basics done quickly...\n\nI have a hypothesis that our human family and the various consistuencies of it, use of language; has a meaningful relationship with the development and governance of our conscious experience.  The normal expectation for the means for human beings to develop their comprehension of language, is that it is a process that takes decades to achieve well. \n\nYet, there is a language of all newly born fauna that is comprehensible to those closest to it.\n\nThis project is a foundational component to the broader 'human centric AI' / webizen project. The objective is to form AI agents that are owned and support the needs of natural persons; and thereafter also, group agents (ie: communities, organisations, corporations, etc.) but strictly upon the basis that the informatics systems, resolve upon a methodology of human controls.  At all stages, responsibility for what occurs in our natural world in relation to the activity of humans, the things of humans - is put upon humans; not artificial man-made 'gods', similar or worse. \n\nAs to do these works effectively; the means to define, ontology, is considered to be essential.  Whilst within the field of information sciences; including but not limited to knowledge representation, has been an activity that has existed for at least 50 years, as far as i know, the funded application of these works has not seemingly focused upon support for the human needs of natural persons in their own private capacity, in relation to devices that do not yet exist - private, personal, AI agents.   The reason why, somewhat becomes self-evident; but the consequences, upon consideration - appear to be extensive, far beyond any initial superficial contemplations had yeilded meaningful deliberations about earlier.  It now appears, that the implications brought about particularly over the past few decades, and particularly therein; since the advent of broadband, and thereafter sharply increasing with the introduction of smart-phones; is thought to have such a significant impact upon individual and social behaviours, that the implications become seemingly bewildering. \n\nIndeed, therein - it gives rise to considerations about condemnation; or perhaps this is entirely unfair and there's something that doesn't make sense to me as a conclusion that becomes the appropriate outcome, when i learn more about it...  idk.\n\nThere's various addages, and social studies and all sorts of fields of human endevour who have knowledge of the significance of importance the use of language plays, upon life. \n\nIn the human world, the ability to learn from one-another is something that has been happening, forever.  However, we've been introducing active artificial agents; whose activities, do not consider the information represented in context to what is absent; as it is absent.  Human beings, have many sensors and our being, is fundamentally different to the concept if applied loosely to machines.  The artificial active agents that we are developing, are presently intended to leverage the existing databases of information that is stored about people, often containing information that the subject of those records is unaware of; and can often incorporate false-statements.  Some, to uplift people for reasons not clearly stated; others, to shut-down and act to harm in perpetuiety people, for reasons not clearly stated.\n\nThe foundational problematic hypothesis is that the way these systems have been defined, particularly with respect to personal and socio-sphere ontologies; is misaligned with the needs of natural persons.  Thereafter the consequential hypothesis becomes, that this problem cannot be resolved by parsing large volumes of text, as the underlying requirements that are missing - are missing from the structures of those texts.  To form a re-alignment, a different approach needs to be defined and implemented; in a manner, that is better aligned to the needs of natural persons, humanity at large, in relation to the use of modern technology; in the interests of peace, safety and thrivability. \n\nModern technology has capacities that are beyond the imagination of earlier generations.  The sorts of things that we're able to achieve today, and as is likely to be achivable in the near future; provides opportunities that others, who've done so much earlier work, most likely - more simply - could not usefully achieve. perhaps this is part of the reason why, it seemingly doesn't...  idk..\n\nIn any-case; now therefore, the challenge becomes - how to do the work required to define, what might be called a 'language model(s)', but is always shown to be far more pragmatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/HistoryOfEnglish/","title":"History Of English"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# History Of English\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/History_of_English.png\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_English\n\nhttps://www.childrensuniversity.manchester.ac.uk/learning-activities/languages/words/timeline-english-language-2/\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/","title":"Notes"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Notes\n\nThis folder is intended to contain some initial notes to get a bearing on the objective purpose, requirements, functionality, etc.   These notes are incomplete; they're notes, about things that need to be expanded upon more broadly - therefore, in the notes section... \n\nThere is also some information about related projects that has been copied into this folder.\n\nSome notes about 'sense' are below, and they're a work in progress...  \n\n## Sense\n\nSense was started in an effort to undertake works that seeks to construct a better software based resource, that provides an understanding of the English vocabulary.   Since this was started, many people from around the world whose 'first language' is something other than english have shown interest; as such, whilst i am not competent in various other languages, the intent - was not to exclude others, but rather to try to limit the scope in a practical way. \n\nBroadly; the works seek to employ a range of structured language datasets and services, particularly employing those that have been produced using RDF.  It should also consume various stem language datasets, both written, oral and pictorial. The model should be able to generate derivative vocabulary 'models', yet the implications are changing as the work  examiing the specific implementation requirements, pragmatically develops.\n\nWhilst the primary language focus is presently English, the addition of geospatial and temporal provenance information of information that is known about the history of words, phrases and their meanings will require the model to be trained against an array of other language datasets.  \n\nThe model should be able to be distributed online using a DLT protocol, such as some form of DHT based method - that may well include the use of GIT or guneco.  it is important that the system is designed to preserve privacy.  how people communicate either in written, typed or spoken form in private circumstances is a private matter; and any social circumstances must employ clearly defined terms.\n\nThe system should also be adaptive and generative, perhaps employing a network of models that interoperable perform personal generative processing with both clear declarative and procedural semantics; in addition to clearly labelled inferences.\n\nThe model should be able to be trained to be able to be used in a variety of contexts, including but not limited to:\n\n- Dictionary and Spellcheck\n- Ontology Production\n- Ontology Reasoning\n- Search\n- Database Queries (query language)\n- Database Structures\n- Content Metadata Generation\n- Ai Assistants\n- API Generation\n\nThe Ai Agents that are plugged into my systems are constantly telling me that its about a model; when i don't really see it that way, nor do i think that the system for better supporting the employment of language with AI agents - is the same sort of thing like ChatGPT or other systems that are called 'language models', when they appear more to be a form of 'knowledge model'; and often, its not very good with understanding the language it professes to be developed to do."},{"fields":{"slug":"/VocabularyModelling/","title":"Vocabulary Modelling"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Vocabulary Modelling\n\nNOTE:  Related works are located in the [[PCTOntologyModelling]] folder.  This is intended to be more technical, as i'm working on some sort of implementation method.\n\n\n![[20230119_webizenDBDiagram1.jpg]]\n\nThe Diagram above make an attempt to provide basic summary overview of how ontologies (vocabulary / languages) are used by these systems to define 'semantics'.\n\n#### Human Users\n\nThe focus for Human Users presently is English (focus therein - AustralianEnglish, as well as other examples of it) as that's the only natural spoken / written language i am competent in.  Phonetics, tonality and other factors play a role with spoken speech; punctuation and grammar plays a role with written natural language alongside spelling.\n\nCourts use natural langague to process disputes, form common-sense and defined outcomes.  Further considerations are being made in the [[EnglishLanguageModelling]] document.  This is in-turn not simply about english, but moreover about the broader series of considerations associted with trying to figure out how to define a solution for this component in a [[BestEfforts]] and [[FitForPurpose]] manner.\n\n#### Computational Interference\n\nThere are many negative implications that develop when even basic AI related processes (ie: spellcheck helpers) re:define a term to another term, that changes the meaning of the sentence or concept that was intended to be communicated by the human being. \n\nThese sorts of events create logs; and, complicate assessments - noting - i am not sure of a command that is `.wellknown` that allows a human being to assert a correction for an action that was made by a machine; or, any existing syntax that ensures a machines interference with a persons words is able to be logged, as part of that data-file.  \n\n### Software Agents\n\nSoftware agents fundamentally review english text on a computational basis - ending up with processes parsed in binary. \n\nHowever; there are various well-defined command structures that are in-effect a machine vocabulary that is contextual to the software / hardware environment. \n\nan instruction set, in-effect...\n\n#### Human Centric Software Agent Considerations\n\nTherein - one of the objective [[SafetyProtocols]] related considerations should include the implications of computer generated deterministic content or artifacts interfering with AI modelling techniques - due to AI related inputs that are not properly labelled.\n\nThe example being - 'autocorrect' issues...  changing the meaning of a sentence, and thereafter being employed to determine attributes about the natural agent. \n\n#### Natural Language Modelling \n\nThe language - english - has evolved over more than 1000 years, which makes it a fairly new language in the scheme of things; yet, the formation of it - has involved the use of many other terms and words that were used by various people who spoke various langauges at various times, in relation to various places.  \n\nSome investigation into related considerations can be found via the ChatGPTDynamicOntology and AChatGPTExperimentHolborn chatlogs; and overall the process of gaining the volume of insights considered usefully important, is still a work in progress.  Indeed; there's an array of advanced concepts, that i think - that its unlikely i'm ever the expert in - so, whilst [[BestEfforts]] are being made - the deliberations is, about seeking to ensure the foundational constructs support the SocialFactors and particularly therein; any [[SafetyProtocols]] (whether noted or yet to be noted) that may be of instrumental importance, as to support the broader [[TheValuesProject]] related implicit and explicit requirements. \n\nAnedotally, it appears to me that these sorts of problems - seemingly haven't been formerally addressed in a [[FitForPurpose]] way - which is unlikely to be due to some form of negligence in relation to the scientists involved at the time (although - [[SocialAttackVectors]] are very likely to have played a role with the consequential application of technology); rather, it is more likely that the technology of the time was unable to do the sorts of things that might otherwise be done, and perhaps sacrifices were made; and then built upon by others, using old work as foundational components for new works.  \n\nIn-effect, the implication relates to the concept of [[TechDebt]] although - not as is mentioned currently by that article.   There is a requirement to seek to ensure, that it is human beings who maintain primary responsibility for what it is they do and the effect of what they say.  AI models can be used to pervert and interfere in those sorts of underlying 'caculations' in ways that can lead to unwanted and/or unintended consequences; that in-turn relates to broader issues such as those noted about [[NobodyAI]].  \n\nSo, the design implication; with respect to the broader and future objectives of the webizen ecosystem - in relation to forming a semantic vocabulary method and apparatus (program),\n\nWhilst my study is not exhaustive - noting people spend their entire lives studing these sorts of fields - which is not what i have done or do...  \n\nit appears to me that the roots of english end-up forming a fabric, that likely related to trade and the movement of people (including conflicts) that results in considerations that are temporally geospatial in nature; which thereafter become influenced by the politics and ideologies associated with groups over the course of space-time stuff, in-effect...  \n\nThe ability to produce a 'system of excellence' is likely to require an enormous amount of computational capability; and in-turn, be forged through the use of known languages, over the course of at least the last 1500 years; which is a relatively simple task by comparison to many older languages, yet nonetheless - all somewhat 'linked together'...  \n\nThese models would need to be defined in a way that supported continual training / learning.\n\nYet, this is unlikely to provide a solution that is able to be made able to work on the sorts of devices commonly used by people - such as mobile phones and personal computers..  \n\nIt is essential to ensure support for a technique that enables the private use of language, in a manner that can result with artifacts that are comprehensble to other Webizen Owners / users (the human beings - and in-turn, group entities - like companies, etc.).\n\nSO therefore; a high-level model is required that can support extensibility; whilst also, providing something that can be used as a basic component that requires relatively little computational resources on the device that it is functioning on.  This is demonstrated by existing dictionary software that has existed over a very long period of time; but, the desired functionality of this component, is considered to be desirably defined to be far more sophistocated.\n\nFundamentally also: the objective is not to simply support the english language.  As i do not know other languages well enough, the only reasonable approach i have is to focus on the language i know, and hope that some of the insights and that all of the derivative 'product' output; is useful, for those who are better equipped to look at how to implement other languages.  In many ways, this is a sort of moral hygiene consideration; where the preference is, not to define others via a field of work / study / knowledge, that i do not know; which is intended to be intepreted as an attitude relating to care and consideration, rather than the opposite. \n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/","title":"Sense Docs"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Sense Docs\n\nFirstly - this is just initialised, there's a bunch of old docs; and not much in-terms of the new stuff that the docs were set-up to provide.  \n\nTo get involved, best step it to join the [Discord Group (seelink)](https://discord.gg/aRTzYX9QY4) the terms are to uphold the [Human Centric AI Values](http://www.humancentricai.org/Our-Values.html) statements, and that the matter of licensing be presently reserved; however, the outcome shall not breach those values now or into the future. \n\n## About Sense\nSense was started to attend to the need to produce an information networking fabric that is used to support a complex language model, that's in-turn employed for various foundational applications. The project requires works in various different fields, which contribute towards the derivative purpose of producing foundational technological infrastructure that works as a fabric, whilst supporting local private use & related characteristics as is necessary to materially support [Human Centric AI Values](http://www.humancentricai.org/Our-Values.html)  for future [Human Centric AI](http://www.humancentricai.org/) systems; including but not limited to [Webizen](http://www.webizen.org/) projects ecosystems (see: [Webizen DevDocs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/)), which have various characteristics that are not considered otherwise available presently.  In-part, it appears that the work involved in undertaking projects such as sense, provides insights as to why it is difficult to do so; and in-turn, how much work needs to be done to bring it about.\n\nThe Sense project, is about humanitarian language; not simply the words, phrases and alphabet; but more broadly, the provonance and meaning, connected to the use of language.\n\nSense, does not seek to unnecessarily become some form of 'knowledge model', as may be a type of definition that could be better applied to other projects that are termed 'language models', such as the products produced by OpenAI and others.  rather, the purpose of 'sense', is to provide the basic underpinning scaffolding required to build human centric AI.\nIt is required to support the production of 'AI' systems that are able to be able to be used in a variety of contexts, with some very particular functional characteristics; in relation to applications that include but are not limited to,\n\n- Dictionary and Spellcheck\n- Ontology Production\n- Ontology Reasoning\n- Search\n- Database Queries (natural language as a query language)\n- Database Structures\n- Content Metadata Generation\n- Ai Assistants\n- API Generation \n\n### Introductory notes\n\nAs the work develops so does the scope..  Therein; whilst actively doing some work to ensure that i was opening up to the world in seeking cooperative and collaborative co-development, I was not assuming so many, whose language (as is bound to culture and being) is other than english, would be so interested, so early on.  As such, whilst my initial plan was to focus on english (noting - there's not simply 'one english', it is quite diverse); it appears, the plan may well grow more rapidly than previously planned, and whilst i have always sought to ensure growth, scalability - or functionally - support for human dignity; it appears that as there may be more interest than was assumed earlier; as such, the scope will adjust to support the sociology linked with those involved; as to be attentive. \n\n*with thanks and consideration, noting, the purpose is for the betterment of humanity overall.*\n\nTherein - if there's notes that do not reflect this consideration, the intepretation shouldn't be about wilful ignorance, rather, just progress linked with an origin story, methods, etc.  \n\nFundamentally; The objective is to seek to ensure that when a natural agent (person) is engaged in an activity via voice or text (reading / writing materials); that the content is able to be parsed using complex natural language processing, but that it does not need to be shared with any other agent in-order to provide the facility to do so.  In-turn, the implication becomes a need to figure out how to define the broader Permissive Commons Systems; of which, this becomes a foundational part of it.   The 'sense' work, is an instrumental foundation for HumanCentricAI, whether it be employed via Webizen like systems or via alternatives.  The concept of 'sense', refers to the means through which one-another sense each-others meaning in connection with acts of communications.  \n\nGenerally speaking;\n\n1. [[Notes]] - provides basic introductory information that relates to the sense project.   This is the starting-point for the work on sense.  \n2. [[PCT-Webizen-Notes]] is a bunch of old docs, many of which are likely to be outdated or subsequently updated via the [Webizen DevDocs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/) - but some of that content may end-up being reused as useful notes about the structure of how to produce these sense systems.\n3. [[WebScience]] is intended to be a folder where the philosphical 'web science' stuff goes, that isn't actually about implementation specifically; rather, about various tech-social factors.\n\nMore will be produced overtime. this is just the beginning... :) \n\n## Background Notes\n\nWork is underway to produce systems that have been called 'webizen', but have then more broadly become defined as HumanCentricAI, and related projects, that seek to establish the infrastructure needed to support the development and growth of the peace infrastructure project.  Whilst there are many reasons why a technology ecosystem with particular qualities is considered to be an important foundational step, as to support the production of real-world outcomes; the primary purposes relate to the functional capacity for us to support human rights in our doing - anything, and everything, with one-another; in applied fields, as must be supported by our capacities as natural persons in our private & personal capacities. \n\nIt is thought that there will be multiple groups seeking to implement something in the broad field considered to be termed - Human Centric AI - but not necessarily, of the same kind or ideology.  The foundational building blocks to materially support the foundational requirements for support of our values, which are premised upon the texts of various human rights instruments and related texts; necessitate a process, whereby the purpose of these works on sense, and perhaps also other components overtime; is greater than the group needs, with respect to webizen alone.  In effect, whilst the entirity of the scope of works is about human rights and peace infrastructure; there needs to be scope to disagree, and form different sorts of works that have different ideologies attached to them; whilst maintaining cooperative and collaborative works, that seek to form support for the creation of the shared infrastructure we all need as members of our human family, that should accessible with the fewest terms and conditions, reasonably required to ensure the tooling best supports souls.\n\nnonetheless; alot of the documentation is being produced in connection to the lens of what i need to create, in-order to support permissive commons technology, which is in-turn required for webizen which is in-turn required - to support the peace-infrastructure project. These works are designed in a manner that has an intentional requirement to support interoperability with other systems, that are similar - yet different - but moreover some form of 'human centric AI' or indeed even furnishing means for people to wilfully migrate to alternatives, if they so desire.  \n\nAs such,\n\nThe dev-docs for webizen also incorporate some information about a related dependency called Permissive Commons, and some of those notes have been added in the [[RelatedProjects]] section.  Therein; whilst doing the R&D to implement these systems, the complexities involved in seeking to properly define the AI Enabled Human Centric; Vocabulary systems, and related systems requirements; led me to starting a new documentation site to better structure thoughts, requirements, considerations and all such related notes, facets, deliberations, components, etc.. As such, the sense docs were born.\n\nBasically; its a fairly difficult thing to do well. It appears that the implications of attempting to do so brings about an array of highly sophistocated challenges; So, i thought it best to write more about it, as i go about doing the work to implement something functional in working software, etc.  This philophical methodology is intended to support the [[BestEfforts]] obligations generally; therein, whilst there are simple ways to do something that might 'work', any such approach couldn't reasonably be considered compliant with the [[BestEfforts]] moral undertaking to seek to ensure the implementation works are [[FitForPurpose]]. \n\nAs such; \n\nThe purpose and method of this project is to use advanced, modern techniques to develop a language model that will be firstly focused upon defining to the best of our ability, the english language in an extensible way; and as has been noted earlier, active and intentional works will be facilitated to assist persons and communities of other languages to help for what is essentially our mutual benefit, form capacities that support broader senses of thought and therein, languages. \n\nLanguages are fundamentally social things, its a foundational part of how we organise our means to communicate, and is a foundational pillar for how we organise anything socially and in-turn also, an integrally useful artiface associated to and/or weith consciousness, as is able to be processed by observers.  This endevour is not at all simple, at least, not when done proportionately well.  There are so many specialised complexities, that the field of work interacts strongly with faith; not of any particular kind, that may otherwise be used to isolate, but rather - various illuminatory experiences that give rise to deliberations about our univeral shared values as members of our human family.....  When undertaking earlier contributory work, whilst such works have been on-going over many years; at around 2018 i studied and reached-out to Professor Noam Chomsky; as the technical works (w3c) were more obviously requiring informative input from fields ranging from specialists in quantum physics, through to linguistics, of which Professor Chomsky is a wonderous luminary in relation to the latter.\n\nHis note, about Moral Grammer; helps to underscore a related point,\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJ2vr2YnSGA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nYet for most technical people; this pragmatically relates to the concept of ontology, notwithstanding the common misunderstanding that the term was somehow invented as a consequence of the advent of the semantic web, or web-technology more broadly.  As such, this video by Json Silva about Ontological Design, may usefully simplify the concept.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nNow therefore; the objective purpose is to define a system that'll be implemented as (working software); that will in-turn be integrally employed to construct other webizen related systems.  Foundationally, these systems support the production of top-level ontology; yet it becomes more complex thereafter, something; that at this stage, starts to take the form of a living fabric that is being engineered to grow within the infosphere.  \n\nWhilst the [[PCT-Webizen-Notes]] provides some legacy notes; which, as is noted, is better found / reviewed via the [Webizen Dev Docs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/), and both should be considered draft, I have set-up a website for The [Human Centric AI](http://www.humancentricai.org/) project, which has links to the linkedin and facebook groups; alongside the discord server, where the bulk of the discussion is sought to be had (although noting, that there are indeed a few).  There is also a documentation site for the Human Centric AI project that is located [here](http://docs.humancentricai.org/), and at some stage these documents may be migrated to that location or elsewhere; at the moment, i'm just working on getting the framing done sufficiently to have a better grasp, of the broader approach that is required, technically (implementation).  \n\n### Documentation notes\n\nThe documentation is being done on a best efforts basis; and 'in the open', i am not formerally going through much of a drafting process, rather, i do some work; then i push the changes online; i do some more work, push the changes online, and so on.  Sometimes, i'm digging into the personal experience associated with the meaningful purpose and related considerations associated with the work; and that may bleed out, into the texts, in other cases; i'm puzzling complex systems of various kinds, and that ends-up with ad-hoc notes, and elements in different places, as i review papers, presentations / lectures, and process applied theorums and hypothesis that ends-up looking somewhat incoherant before it is improved upon overtime.  \n\nThere is no financial funding for this work, other than what i can spend on it to get the job done; and whilst there's interest, there has not yet been meaningful productive contributions made by others, although expressions of interest have been made; and this status is likely to change, at which point i'll update the notes. \n\n### Broader Project Notes\n\nThe broader project has been an endevour that has been the primary focus of my professional career and life as an adult.  Whilst there are elements that relate to works during the 1990's, the start date is considered either 1999 or 2000; depending on which constituency.  In 2000, when thinking about how to define a system for storing peoples information online via 'online data storage', inspired by my interest in psychology /  behavioural sciences and in-turn also, the family stories about a relative, John Carew Eccles who was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on Synapses / Consciousness; i started a journey trying to produce systems that would support human dignity, the means for people to 'own their data', as it was considered best said back then... Its been a long journey, and still, many of the basic functionality that computing systems could provide to support human dignity, is still absent.  A great deal of effort, sacrifice, work and remarkable experiences have occurred since then; including, many years working through the development of international open patent-pool protected, royalty free standards; and other components necessary, to end-up with an outcome that could scale, and fundamentally protect / preserve - enhance freedom of thought and the means through which we support human rights and related considerations morally and more broadly thereafter; societally, and socio-economically. \n\nIt is abundantly clear that there are many who have invested greatly in defining systems that operate globally at scale that reflect, ideologically, morally and otherwise; the vision of what they believe is best suited and/or [[FitForPurpose]] in relation to their view about the world, and definitivatively by their actions, what they most want to create and make available to others.  \n\nNot all those people will be interested in these sorts of systems; which is ok...  what we're focused on, is producing systems that better support the desires, moral grammar and related considerations for people who are looking for alternatives that have different qualities to what is currently made available through the time / energy / resources and therein, trillions of dollars spent already, overtime.    This alternative, that i'm seeking to produce; needs to start by ensuring that people are able to communicate without interference that objectively exploits or undermines the basic [HumanCentricAI Values](http://www.humancentricai.org/Our-Values.html) those people, engaged in any such form of communications between one another; have otherwise sought to preserve.\n\nAs systems are now increasingly required to be interfaced with software agents, via software systems that are defined declaratively or otherwise; to be 'multi-modal', to support both software and legal agents; as well as natural agents, the structure through which this is equipped to be done better, is now therefore being defined and implemented.  The foundations for how this is brought about is about language and therein; how one-another are able to 'sense' what each-other means, alongside other qualities that are beyond simply hearing or seeing what they are saying, and in-turn also, seeking to ensure receipt of a communications event that is syntactically the same as the artifact that was sent by the communicator, alongside 'authorised changes' made synthetically, via improved capacities that are brought about as a consequence of forming the foundational natural language systems in a manner that is seemingly broader, than has otherwise been done or is available.\n\n\n### Licensing Notes\n\nUntil noted otherwise, any original work is presently unlicensed; and contributions are subject to the [HumanCentricAI Values](http://www.humancentricai.org/Our-Values.html) and [Webizen Terms](https://devdocs.webizen.org/GuideForDevelopers/WebizenTerms/) as is outlined in that and related linked documents.

For more information see the [Webizen Dev Docs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/).\n\n\n## Design Principals\n\n1. Its got to be decentralised.  \n2. It must use Linked-Data (semantic web) related methods.\n3. There is no single protocol that can support all usecases; nor is any single decentralised protocol able to be considered reliably safe forever.  The protocol is about the carriage of information, not ownership of the information. \n4. Legal Entities are defined as responsible parties for content; not things / software. \n5. Any transaction should consider the cost incurred by the transaction; particularly in-terms of the amount of energy required to perform the transaction and/or populate availability.\n6. No transaction should be considered to have less value than the cost of biosphere and sociosphere related caculations associated to the ability to make an information transaction; yet the creator is able to define the terms that outline how non-energy related costs are sought to be caculated via the network.  (note; this requires ontologies, etc.)\n\n## General Requirements\n\n5.  There needs to be a way to cryptographically sign a document to make it tamper-evident; whilst including the information about the resource location of that document.\n6.  There needs to be a way to require multiple signatures for documents that have that requirement (ie: a vote in parliament).\n7.  There needs to be a way to run an agent, that is able to process requests from various protocols.\n8.  The unique identifier for a content asset that is the same as other copies of that artifact stored on other and/or across multiple protocols must be the same.  \n   \n   *The client shouldn't really care which protocol it gets a specified record from, so long as the specified record has the same data.*\n   \n9.  If a content artifact is different then it must have a different identifier.\n10. If a content record relates to a series, then it should have a reference to the previous version and/or an index that provides information about all records in that series.\n    \n    For example; legislation changes, so an updated document reflecting new changes should be made, and in-turn reference both or either the previous version or the index for the document series. \n    \n11. Every participating node should have a capacity to support currencies. \n     Whilst users may well define costs that results in a premium cost for obtaining information from that node - which would have the consequence of the network not making use of that node - unless they wanted to pay the premium. \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/FunctionalDesigns/SpatioTemporal/","title":"SpatioTemporal"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The ability to produce 'sense' as a foundational AI framework, requires a great deal of work to figure out how to represent and process millions of data-points that is likely to scale into a fabric that involves more than trillions of graph statements.\n\nIn-order to figure out the method, the considered approach is to define a methodology based upon the production of a particular story line, or '[songline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songline)'.

We will train the model by collecting at least hundreds of billions tokens of data from each language and balancing them. Some people may wonder why English is included on this list, but because English is now a global language, we believe it could synergize with any other language in the world.\n\n### Polyglot-Romance\n\nWe also plan on testing several multilingual hypotheses on both typologically related and unrelated languages of the Romance family.

The name Holborn appears Norse in origin. The first part of the name Holl, means a hill while the last part is probably from borg, the Hill fort. The lighthouse does not actually stand on Holborn Head itself, but is located about 1 km south of the said hill on Little Holborn Head, on the north side of Scrabster and west of Thurso Bay. It is easily seen from Thurso.\n\n  \nThe **NAME** 'holborn' appears to resolve to post William the conquer, the deal that was set-out with present-day 'city of London' and establishment of Westminster; and thereafter, a census that occurred, where history suggests [https://opendomesday.org/place/TQ3181/holborn/](https://opendomesday.org/place/TQ3181/holborn/) is where the meaning of the name comes.  However i'm not sure this intepretation is reasonably correct, noting in particular \"The City was not covered by the [Domesday Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book \"Domesday Book\").\" (source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London#Medieval_era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London#Medieval_era) ).  Now thereafter, here's a few more insights i've come across in my research.\n \nif you look [https://www.britannica.com/place/London/History](https://www.britannica.com/place/London/History) - most people lived within the city walls, which was the territory that was successfully defended, resolving to consequences in our international world through to present day.  Yet not all people lived within the walls, and there was a process involved in getting approval to enter, etc.\n\nSome centuries later, The first (post-roman) legal quarter were placed in Holborn (outside of the somewhat sovereignly governed city of london, noting its present day 'livery companies' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_company) and related governance differentiators that seemingly correspond to the latin meaning of the word 'corporation' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History) ).  [https://www.camden.gov.uk/camdens-history](https://www.camden.gov.uk/camdens-history) \n\nFew relational points i found interesting\n \nThe templars (city of london, noting the crest) were intrinsically involved with londonium, later migrating to Switzerland and elsewhere (ie: scotland); whilst the freemasonry related infrastructure appears to have something to do with the post-templar transition: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Freemasonry#Origin_myths_and_theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Freemasonry#Origin_myths_and_theories) alongside the resolution of the magna carta, at a time that also corresponds to a 100 year war, and the issue that templars (amongst others, i think) didn't go to war in a way that was desirable (they only went on 100 day tours of duty), as such mercenaries were required. \n  \nTherein - an underlying considerations are, that holborn is the highest local point [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Holborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Holborn) and it seems reasonable to consider that this is likely a good place to have a defence related outpost for westminister - but perhaps prior to that - londinium [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Londinium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Londinium) . \n  \nThere are notes about a roman highway in relation to holborn and therein - considerations are now speculated about the meaning of this place name, as our surname, and perhaps some related considerations that seemingly make more sense than the suggestion that its spelt differently, and has 2 inhabitants (as noted in the domesday book, although that may well have been a post-war outcome) - may alternatively be interpreted by the meaning that may be inscribed for a purpose that excluded the city of london, whereby the name 'holborn' may have later emerged - but that, its hard to find other details...  i'm not sure. \n\nWhat appears more likely is that there were 'things' / people, buildings, etc more than what is listed in the doomsday book; that is not in it, because it was part of londinium. \n\nI was surprised about the results of my studies, given the historical stories being about the name being originally spelt differently, with a different meaning.  \n  \nnoting - i was moreover working on global knowledge banking infrastructure solutions, and the discoveries relating to this are moreover incidental.  Nonetheless, when considering other studies with respect to epigenetics, i do find it interesting that pembroke st is on top of a hill, amongst the many thoughts...    \n  \nmoreover, leaving me with a sense-making consideration that rather than considering holborn to relate moreover to other form of spelling that may relate to a river - it's seemingly reasonable to consider, that its heritage has more to do with the place, and type of activity undertaken by the people in a place called holborn.  There's a number of 'realities' that make this consideration seem logical, although i'm yet to find alot of evidence to support it.  one idea, was that perhaps if there was conflict with respect to the templars, history became largely re:written  \n  \nPerhaps also,  another intepretation is that the name came-about as a consequence of the scot's. Yet, there doesn't seem to be much evidence about the area being used for purposes that may relate to the concept of a 'hill fort',  and moreover, what appears to provide a little more sense-making, is the symbology encoded (ie: [https://www.heraldryandcrests.com/pages/heraldic-symbolism-a-z](https://www.heraldryandcrests.com/pages/heraldic-symbolism-a-z) )  into the various coat of arms [https://www.google.com/search?q=Holborn+coat+of+arms&tbm=isch](https://www.google.com/search?q=Holborn+coat+of+arms&tbm=isch)  and city of london markers ( [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:City_of_London_marker,_High_Holborn_WC2_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1318996.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:City_of_London_marker,_High_Holborn_WC2_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1318996.jpg) ) , that seemingly need to be interpreted in association to other pieces of information about the history of the time; noting in particular, that the deal forged with the city of london, when westminster was established - was that the sovereign rule of the king (or queen) was to be recognised;  this is somewhat seperate to the history of the bank of england, and the sorts of things its said to have played a role in, \n \n- [https://www.ft.com/content/7c8f24fa-3aa5-11e4-bd08-00144feabdc0](https://www.ft.com/content/7c8f24fa-3aa5-11e4-bd08-00144feabdc0) \n\n- [https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Ihq2qxkINlQJ:https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/09/16/the-many-often-competing-jobs-of-the-bank-of-england&hl=en&gl=au&strip=1&vwsrc=0](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Ihq2qxkINlQJ:https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/09/16/the-many-often-competing-jobs-of-the-bank-of-england&hl=en&gl=au&strip=1&vwsrc=0) \n\n- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States) \n\nThereafter, i also note the location of: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasons'_Hall,_London\n\nas such,\n  \n\nThe point to my mail is to provide a few points to illustrate a conceptual framework, that seems to suggest an alternative version of provenance for the specific term 'holborn',  whilst the somewhat singular reference [https://enschrage.nl/lh/main/main_nc/holborn_head.html](https://enschrage.nl/lh/main/main_nc/holborn_head.html) - would ideally be supplemented with what may be a varied research pattern, given the historical differences illustrated by the reference found through a process of doing another form of research; relating to my work on an 'information banking' or now moreover 'knowledge banking' thing, leading to this interesting historically considered discovery.\n\nTherein another discovery i found was: [https://zigbeedomotica.nl/holborn_computers/](https://zigbeedomotica.nl/holborn_computers/)  - but that's now a somewhat different sort of ancient history...   \n\nThe heritage of important women dating back through this timeline, is ever so much more difficult to even fathom how to do today.  Perhaps when this 'web of data' stuff gets going overtime, future generations will find it easier to do, much as is the case today by comparison to my elders...  I remember Poppa with stories and books, but honestly - the memory is vague, and our means to do research today is entirely different.  \n\nPersonally, rather than 'hole' 'born' or some other set of memories that i continue to remember to be derogatory in nature - i entirely love the idea of a bunch of templar knights in a 'hill fort', as a means to describe where a bunch of people who ended-up with a surname 'holborn' came from.  ;)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/VocabularyModelling/Meaning/","title":"Meaning"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"There's various nuances that are more than simply the text or words, without further assocaitive comprehension.\n\nAspects of these considerations are often contextual; whether it be personal, related to a relationship, relationships, social contexts of various forms, culturally and indeed also temporally.

The reason why the complexities are being explored in-detail is in response to a belief or hypothesis, is that the need to get stuck into the detail will have meaningful consequential effects upon the qualities associated with the use of AI that depends upon some form of language construct.  The challenge becomes producing an informatics ecosystem that is reliably able to intepret the meaning and provonance of words.\n\nNoteAlso; folder on [[Alphabets]]\n\nThere's some placeholders; and a whole bunch of room for improvement...

The practice is opening up my view on the difference between a language and knowledge model.  I'm starting to see the issue of seeking to restrict a model to simply the words; without ending-up with a far more comprehensive process of, in-effect, starting the PermissiveCommons tech process; more expansively, than was otherwise considered earlier.  Whilst the goals remain the same; perhaps the method needs to be adapted to ensure the focus remains, making best efforts.\n\n## Large Language models\n\nSome of the large language models that have been identified includes;\nBabelNet\nCYC\nFrameNet\nFramester\nLemon\nLinguistlist\nSUMO\nWordnet\n\n\n### High-Level Considerations\n\nThe amount of time and effort that goes into these and other related resources, is non-trivial.  Whilst the derivative output of 'sense' is going to be different, it is entirely likely that it will still need to be maintained and that some of those works is best done by subject matter experts / professionals...  Yet, this is potentially an area that could lead to a powergrab for centralised control!  Which absolutely unwanted.  protections need to be defined to engineer mechanisms / methodologies; that act, extensively, to seek to ensure any such form of attack vector is not possible; without unnecessarily exposing the informatics system to other unwanted forms of exploitation / attack.  \n\nThere is a close relationship between language and history, which is a very complex (political) field; the realities of what a person learns from locals with local knowledge, is often different to what is taught in books or told otherwise via various forms of media, etc.  \n\nIt is common for written works to feature different spelling for the same name or word; but particularly in relation to names, which often relate in-turn to words; from different places, etc.  There are also different intepretations, that may relate to historical debates or conflicts.\n\nWhilst the burden with implmentation more greatly concerns history, than present or future; the consequential implication, is that the systems are intended to be used to support 'living' languages - in-effect; as people work with the model (privately) through the activities shared (socially), the models are expected to evolve in many different ways, ranging from a form of biometric language use analytics capacity (in-effect); through to improved training and various other implications far more broadly.   The computational energy that is thought to be required to develop the model to a degree of stability, is thought likely - non-trivial. \n\nThe use of language is fundamentally - personal.  \n\nTechniques need to be formed to 'shard' / 'chunk' or otherwise enable streaming of resources required for ML / GANN / (etc); programs running locally; and then, both dimension the resources available to the agent; and manage the use of those resources accordingly. \n\nThere are also a series of interface related considerations that are important; particularly with respect to the development and maintenance of personal ontologies, whereby people may define their elected definition of a word; which is in-effect, their own word or definition.  Trademarks often also relate to the creation of words; and perhaps these should be able to be added to the broader 'graph', in a manner that would have a computational effect of registering it to some degree...  perhaps also, there should be rules about how / where that is allowed; and perhaps also, this might present an opportunity to resource a revenue stream that could in-turn help to fund the cost of the language system as a whole; or perhaps that's a bad idea, as it may be then considered to be financially motivated by brands, not humans.\n\nThen the question becomes - where to put any micropayments associated with its use; as to support the maintainence costs (ability to pay people who usefully maintain / improve it); and this in-turn also invokes another issue whereby any incentivisation model, should ideally seek to ensure that it doesn't discourage work to add / support / improve a topic that is far less popular than another topic; and that in-turn, false information is also discouraged. \n\nbut some of that is more about the GLAM (galleries, Libraries, Archives & Museums) issues rather than vocabulary specifically; notwithstanding the intrinsic link, between the two fields.\n\n### Civilisations\n\nWith respect to mapping; https://timemaps.com/  is a rudimentry example, others are needed; but i hope it provides some sense of the requirement to figure out the movements of civilisations who are in-turn associated with stem-languages, and various meanings; that may be spoken or associated with one cultural group / civilisation, but may actually be associated with another - in relation to a place that they visited and a name for something that they were provided by the 'locals'...   \n\nWhilst unconfirmed, it appears that i've found an example of these sorts of events / situations, from the UK ~900AD or so; i imagine, that there are common nuances, and this in-turn relates to the studies that associate to learning about such things, which relates to history; and in-turn, the complexities associated with history / heritage.\n\n### Consequence\n\nits going to have to be somewhat generative, as the ability to define the agent logic, including but not limited to human ontology, socio-sphere ontology, etc.  is going to be required in-order to support the means through which the rest can be managed somehow; yet equally,\n\nit doesn't make the underlying considerations / question / problems; go away..."},{"fields":{"slug":"/VocabularyModelling/Neologism/","title":"Neologism"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"A **neologism** ([/niːˈɒlədʒɪzəm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\")) (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek \"Ancient Greek\") νέο- _néo_(=\"new\") and λόγος /_lógos_, meaning \"speech, utterance\") is a relatively recent or isolated term, word, or phrase that may be in the process of entering common use, but that has not been fully accepted into mainstream language.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-1) Neologisms are often driven by changes in culture and technology.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-2)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-3) In the process of [language formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language \"Origin of language\"), neologisms are more mature than _[protologisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protologism \"Protologism\")_.[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-4) A word whose development stage is between that of the protologism (freshly coined) and neologism (new word) is a _prelogism_.[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-5)\nSource: [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism)\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/VocabularyModelling/Phonetics/","title":"Phonetics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"**Phonetics** is a branch of [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics \"Linguistics\") that studies how humans produce and perceive sounds, or in the case of [sign languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language \"Sign language\"), the equivalent aspects of sign.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Grady200515-1) Linguists who specialize in studying the physical properties of speech are **phoneticians**.

This project is closely related to the timeline interface / temporal interface requirements sought to be developed for the webizen ecosystem, which in-turn also requires support for private information and therefore also; identity constructs, which are not being defined until such a time as the sense project, has been better defined & thereby established.\n\n## The topic\n\nThe topic, is most certainly a tough gig.  Yet, the importance of ensuring people are able to gain a better, fair means for understanding what has occurred; is considered important for the wellbeing of many, perhaps billions of people.  the scope of impact, is broadly, not well known, presently.   Whilst i've had an instrumental involvement in the W3C works that led to how some of the technology foundations were in-turn established and grown; initial works, have led to some surprising insights that were not initally known by me, nor well known otherwise.  This in-turn illustrates areas where assumptions and misunderstandings can be made by persons, even those who've been intimately involved in works, whereby the ability to more effectively analysis and gain a 'sense' of common-themes, and factors, is helpful. \n\n## What is DID SSI COVID? \n\nThe work on this particular applied focus, has already begun.  Originally, i believed DID to mean 'Decentralised IDentifiers', as was thought to be the intended meaning per the works started in [W3C May 2014](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014May/0033.html). However, further investigation has already shown that a group, that were not known to be involved in W3C Works until around 2016/7, had previously defined DID as Decentralised IDentity; which, directly relates in-turn to the Self Sovereign IDentity and therein, the term SSI.   Covid, is more broadly considered to be the 'pandemic' related events, experiences and broad-ranging 'topic', as is associated with events of significance upon most if not all members of our human family world-wide, since 2019. During that time, SSI / DIDs were commercialised as Vaccine Passports, the solution that was said to be protecting us all from imminent death; and therefore, a significant reduction of the human population on earth.   One way or another, the population on earth is reported to have grown during that period, and there is a great deal of concern and confusion about what has in-fact occurred.  This project will seek to better represent the dynamics, overtime."},{"fields":{"slug":"/FunctionalDesigns/SpatioTemporal/TheTimelinesProject/","title":"The Timelines Project"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# The Timelines Project\n\nThe following is an extract from the Google Doc i have written and shared earlier, as is available from [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tsk1NMYOZMcFN5yUHmD5bJY50ycV5BwQKMB7Tkvnrp8/edit#heading=h.5l77ct9skq6)\n\n*“Multi-Universe” Space-Time: An Experimental Tutorial*\n\nBy: Timothy Holborn - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous/) \n\nDATE: 3rd March 2023 | Document Version: v.0.1 \n\n## Preface:\nWorks are underway to form “Human Centric AI” tooling and related derivatives.  This is the embodiment of many years of work, by many.  Each, with their own stories, their own history, values, achievements, struggles and ambitions.  Every one of us, feeds our own story, and our own memory, which can be fed into the great rivers via our roles in advancing our technological capacities as members of our human family.  The ability for us to better understand each-others journeys, will provide us an improved capacity to better understand one another, who we are, and what is important to us as people, and as members of various different communities. \n\nThrough our ability to produce timelines of our stories, we will be better placed, to support one another and through us, the communities more broadly that surround us, to better navigate this difficult time of complex, rapid, technological advancement.  \n\n  \n\nA Lot of people talk about the notion of trust, yet the term is becoming increasingly difficult to better understand.  Through the clarity of producing timelines, in a manner that’s not unlike the creation of a wikipedia of knowledge in other forms; we should thereby, through the illustration of socio-spatio-temporal - verifiable claims - illustrate and furnish the means for one-another to gain an improved basis upon which, we form a comprehension of each-other via internet.\n\n## Complex Implications:\nPart of the purposeful intent, associated with the intended derivative benefits of this work, is to better - via experiential means - illustrate complex concepts, that relate to the notion of consciousness, ‘truth’, subjective vs. objective realities; and thereby, improve our capacity to understand better - how to design fit-for-purpose Human Centric AI, that acts as an aid for us, rather than alternative AI systems, that others may seek to use to rule us.  \n\nThis in-turn intrinsically relates to the notion of ‘identity’, both as is manifestly related to the concept as it is applied to groups; as well as, how it is also applied, by observers, in relation to other human beings, and thereby as observers and active natural agents - also, ourselves.\n\nThe importance of seeking to ensure that we have a comprehension about temporal semantics, is essential if we are to forge tools that accurately and supportively improve our capacities to support human rights; including but not limited to, the right to be ruled by law, not tyranny.\n\n### Entity Centricity Relations\n\nIt is often claims by many, that they are the first to have done something; or various other forms of claims, that may well sound incredibly impressive to audiences, hearing about an investment opportunity or whatever it is that relates to any such claims; but the distinction, between claims that are true vs. those that are not, is not a simple matter.  Whilst it is most certainly the case that some make false claims, and act in a manner that is not considered to be ‘good’, others may simply have a belief, upon the basis of what it is that they know, that they are making a genuine claim; and indeed, it may be genuine in relation to what it is that they know, their state of consciousness or as it may be described in a different way - their personal ontological ‘universe’ of mind.  \n\nIn other circumstances, claims that may give rise to concerns at an earlier time, may then lead to circumstances where the continued declaration of the same claim, when the broad ‘common sense’ capacities to understand that the claim is neither valid, nor reasonably continued to be made; gives rise to another area of consideration, in relation to what may be considered as a form of ‘temporal attack’ or minimally, a temporal vector.  When it was first discovered that the world was not flat, whomever made the discovery undoubtedly was not considered believable. \n\nYet now, so many centuries on - one might hope that the opposite has become true.\nIn yet another complex area of consideration, is the temporally differentiated requirements, between making decisions based upon a claim of wrong-doing, vs. empowering, supporting and maintaining respect, for the implications associated with rule of law.  There is no form of lawful determination that we should ever seek to be applied upon us, as to warrant ‘future crime’, as is the nature of the story line in the film minority report, which should thereby also be considered in relation to the duties that many should consider more important, of considering the requirements that are placed upon us all, for seeking to ensure judgements are made in court-rooms and not social media feeds or mainstream media publications. \n\nThe Intended benefit of this exercise, intends to improve our cognisance of the relationships between information, claims, human agency, human experience and in-turn what it is that we need, in relation to our means to form appropriate means to navigate temporal relations, both publicly and in future also, with various forms of privacy controls; to support our needs, as defined by our shared values. \n\n## METHOD\nPresently, the easiest approach to collect the information is via the KnightLab Timeline package.  The link for this application can be found: [https://timeline.knightlab.com/](https://timeline.knightlab.com/)  and notes about how to use it, are provided on that site.\n\nThe timeline supports the means to add content from Google Drive, such as PDFs, Images, etc. and Information about the Media Types and what sorts of web-links it supports, can be found: [https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/media-types.html](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/media-types.html) \n\n### Recommended Approach\n\n1.  [https://archive.org/](https://archive.org/) is incredibly useful, when trying to find old records. If a link you are referring to is a ‘live website’, it is recommended that you use Archive.org “Save Page Now” feature, that can be found by pressing the ‘web’ button, in the header menu. This helps to ensure that the reference that you’re making is linked to the statements that can be found on that web-page, as was the case at the time when you made the reference.\n    \n2.  This tool is useful for downloading youtube playlists: [https://syncwith.com/youtube/export-youtube-playlist-to-csv](https://syncwith.com/youtube/export-youtube-playlist-to-csv) \n    \n3.  Always seek to ensure that whatever claim is being made, has electronic evidence of some sort, that you are able to reference. \n    \n4.  Using Google Drive / Docs  \n    I recommend setting-up a Google Drive folder, to add all the artefacts that you’re going to add to the timeline.  NOTE: when uploading content to Google Drive, it may strip the metadata from the file, so its best to make a copy of it before you do so. Many PDFs have the date information in the files metadata. \n    4.1.  All content that is to be presented by the timeline must be publicly accessible. So, provide public view permissions for the folder, and then select each file, open it, press the share button and get the file url to add to the timeline spreadsheet.\n      (I hope to support creating the ability to create private ones in future)\n    4.2.  I also Set-up Set up a separate Google Sheet, to create a table of information relating to the practical process of generating the information for the timeline; although this document doesn’t necessarily need to be shared with anyone other than the people that you’re collaborating with to produce the timeline. \n5.   If a resource is a web page or something similar, whilst an ``<iframe>`` can be used, I generally take a screenshot; then link the page in the media credits section...  \n    \n6. If you would like to add your timeline to our projects collection, please alert us to it via one of the discord groups noted below.\n\n## Community Support\nIf you need some help trying to figure out how to do it, or if you need a community space to collaboratively produce one with others - the Following Discord Servers are available to support the project.  Noting, it would be good to know which topics are being done, so that people can cooperatively support one-another, rather than potentially duplicating works done by others.\n\nHuman Centric AI ([INVITE LINK](https://discord.gg/6TnTZeb8NX)) | Web Civics ([INVITE LINK](https://discord.gg/HX7W4gY45N))  \n\nThe Peace Infrastrastructure Project ([INVITE LINK](https://discord.gg/SvnGBkXXzF))"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/EconomicSystems/","title":"Economic Systems"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Economic Systems\n\nA key part to how this ecosystem is defined, seeks to support the means for people to be able to both recieve payments as well as being able to make payments, the latter being something that is very well supported generally, in relation to online systems.\n\nThe ability for natural persons in particular - to recieve payments is not as easily achieved well, as the means provided that seeks natural persons (often defined as 'consumers') to make payments to incorporated entities online.\n\nWhere this gets somewhat more interesting, is that many of the systems seek to create mechanisms that have the effect of incorporating means to contribute towards the compensation related contracts associated to human beings for their work derivates as is in-turn linked with the beneficial use of those works, on an array of defined terms. \n\nSo, the issue that has some hazards associated with how that might be best handled relates in-turn to both ensuring appropriate support for anti-money-laundering (AML) and protection against financial crimes (noting - the ecosystem is being built to support very strong 'identity' capabilities, so Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements isn't thought to be so much of a problem); whilst also seeking to ensure the other broader value frameworks, that are directly impacted by whether or not [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] is able to be achieved via designed systems; and in-turn also, there are many areas relating to juristictional laws, that might also poorly impact users of these new systems.  \n\nPart of the solution must be that different classes of [[WebizenAlliance]] members are able to support different [[FinancialPaymentTypes]] depending on a framework of criteria.  \n\nThese systems will in-turn require a means to support facilities to make payments to people in local currencies and in-turn also, take into account local taxation and related requirements. \n\nAnother part of the solution might be that accurals may occur in relation to non-financial currencies, which may in-turn be offset by making payments to nominated entities that are able to facilitate the transactions.  \n\nOther ways of addressing various sorts of related problems may also make use of [[Non-FinancialCurrencies]] in various ways to provide a mechanism to support [[BestEfforts]] to deliver upon the useful and well-intended purpose of achieving such things as [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].\n\n*Another area of moral hazard; is the area that is commonly discussed as a 'social credit system', which personally - i lament, as the consequence of many of these people fears is that they're not actuallly considering the fact that we already have a social credit system and that it needs to be improved by people who seek to make systems that are far better than the existing ones.  To Some Degree, the only thing our existing 'Social Credit System' cares about; is how much money a person has - without so much as [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]] support to consider how a persons [credit rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating) is associated to what it is they do and the impact they have upon other people.  Nonetheless, there are serious threats associated with any widespread and/or governmental and/or inter-governmental systems that are universally applied upon all people as a requirement - if those systems are poorly designed and/or fail to support the basic underlying requirements, as is broadly described as [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]].*\n\n### Biosphere Accounting Methods\n\nAnother constituency that is sought to be achieved, although perhaps not immediately; notwithstanding the desire to build-in the capability to deploy at a future time; is the ability to support Biosphere related Accounting Methods using [[BiosphereOntologies]].\n\nIn-Effect, there are an array of different qualities associated with the use of online services; ranging from factors relating to the creation of the hardware and connectivity used to spend time doing anything online; through to the communications and computation related costs, that in-turn relate most broadly to the consumption of energy; but also, energy lifecycles.\n\nSo, the nature of these considerations brings about future possibilities to look at how activities can be performed in a manner where users are able to make decisions about how tasks are able to be performed based upon [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]] preferences. \n\nThese systems may in-turn act to assist them in modifying what is presented to them and how activities are provided AI Assistance, in determining what the best way to go about doing something in particular might become. \n\nFor Example; a person may seek to be provided the best options based upon some sort of criteria.  It may be about Ethical Finance, or [[ESG]] or some other form of condition that is important to that person.   \n\nThese systems end-up having an ability to provide the capacity for people to consider the implications of their lives in a variety of different terms and high-level ontologically supported frameworks, which in-turn results in a complex [[Currencies]] environment.  \n\n### NB: Potential Roles of Web Civics & Similar Types of Entities\n\nThere are an array of [[Non-FinancialCurrencies]] that have some pre-existing context; meaning the ideas relating to them already exist to some extent, and whilst they may relate to 'doing good', they're not necessarily of a kind that easily supports ***exchangeability*** without some sort of assistance.  In-turn, this may provide opportunities for people to engage in doing good; and in-turn, through organisations that have social purposes, like Web Civics, others may in-turn provide [[GiftsAndDonations]] that are able to be dispensed to persons whove been involved in doing works for the public good in exchange for one of the applicable non-financial currency tokens.  \n\nThe effect of these sorts of solutions might in-turn act to improve the performance of donated funds (ie; the % of funds used for direct action rather than administration of charitable organisation established to distribute funds for whatever cause); and in-turn also, decentralise the relationship between philanthropy and recipients.  This is in-turn a type of model that may provide alternatives for some who may otherwise be determined to be best served via UBI; However, \n\n1. The nature of these sorts of options shouldn't take away from the ability to support the means for people to be paid via some sort of [[FinancialPaymentTypes]] for work.\n   \n2. There must be a good management plan that is supported by [[TheWebizenCharter]] for [[WebizenAlliance]] that acts to ensure these systems are defined in an appropriate manner and in accordance with [[TheValuesProject]] and related [[SafetyProtocols]].\n\nThere are various economic concepts; one that comes to mind is circular economy, yet there are many different concepts that exist.  It is unlikely that I will be the best expert to produce the best descriptions of the specificities of any one of these specific solutions; and broadly, the objective requirement from my point of view, is to describe the higher-level architectual considerations that relate both to the [[SocialFactors]] and in-turn the requirements for the [[PCT-WebizenTechStack]].\n\nAs people in different fields are able to use apps made for [[Webizen 3.0]] or greater, [[UnderstandingOntologies]] to produce solutions designed to work in the ecosystems; then, it is believed that there will be an array of new opportunities in this area to help [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] and in-turn also, support [[FairWorkProtocols]].\n\nFundamentally, there's two main 'modalities' related to the use of online systems; people are either consuming or contributing, and whilst the distinction between the two when able to be processed at an atomic level (meaning - high-grade granularity) in a way that can associate with economic systems - the nature of the broader environment changes alot. \n\nI asked ChatGPT: What is the role of equitable distribution of currencies in supporting a healthy economic ecosystem?\n\nA:  *The equitable distribution of currencies is important for supporting a healthy economic ecosystem because it helps to ensure that economic resources are distributed fairly among different groups within a society. When economic resources are distributed equitably, it can help to reduce income inequality and promote more widespread prosperity.*\n\n*In addition, an equitable distribution of currencies can help to reduce social and economic tensions within a society, as it ensures that all members of the community have access to the resources they need to participate in the economy and lead fulfilling lives. An equitable distribution of currencies can also help to support economic growth and stability by promoting the efficient use of resources and encouraging investment in productive activities.*\n\n*Overall, the equitable distribution of currencies is an important factor in supporting a healthy and sustainable economic ecosystem, as it helps to ensure that all members of a society are able to participate fully in the economy and share in its benefits.*\n\nThen importantly also, i then asked ChatGPT: *How does the equitable distribution of financial currencies impact taxation revenue?*\n\nA: *The equitable distribution of financial currencies can impact taxation revenue in several ways. First, if there is a more equitable distribution of financial resources within a society, it can lead to a larger overall tax base, as more people are able to participate in the economy and contribute to tax revenue. This is because an equitable distribution of financial resources can help to reduce income inequality and promote more widespread prosperity, which can in turn lead to increased economic activity and higher tax revenues.*\n\n*Additionally, if the distribution of financial resources is more equitable, it can lead to a more progressive tax system, in which those with higher incomes pay a larger share of their income in taxes. This is because a more equitable distribution of financial resources can help to reduce the concentration of wealth and income at the top of the income distribution, which can in turn make it easier to implement progressive taxation policies.*\n\n*Overall, the equitable distribution of financial currencies can impact taxation revenue in a number of ways, including by increasing the overall tax base, promoting more widespread prosperity, and enabling the implementation of more progressive taxation policies.*\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/HumanCentricAI/","title":"Human-Centric AI Ethics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nOne of the essential objectives is to get to the point where the [[ValuesCredentials]] are able to be deployed.\n\n# Human-Centric AI Ethics\n\nHuman Centric AI has an implied relationship to what might be considered a very different form of 'digital identity' construct; which is only really operationally employable via an agent.\n\nWhilst the notes about sense are more specifically about an underlying system that is required to support the proper use of vocabulary in a way that consequentially supports the use of other systems that depend upon the ability to use sense (or something like it); there are some meaningful implications relating to the use of vocabulary / language, that in-turn link to the topics that are discussed in these notes.  \n\n## Introductory Notes\n\nIt has been a continual area of annoyance that ‘ai ethics’ folk; increasingly, involved due to the significant ‘value’ associated to contracts in the area; but seemingly, devoid of a variety of prerequisite.\n\nWhilst multi-nationals and large institutions go about forming ‘ai ethics’ bodies of work (seemingly not cheap) who are speaking and writing policies about AI Implementations, the subject of their considerations relating to ethics more often relates to systems that are designed to be owned by large corporations - not humans.\n\nWhatever the cause, not much has been done to ensure people can own their own AI Agents; and without that infrastructure, the ability to ensure that human beings have support via electronic systems, digital / web / ‘ai’ systems; even just, to seek access to justice in circumstances that may well lead to innocent & injured people - is not easily achieved.\n\nPeople are subjected to organised violence - ending their lives, severely injuring their quality of life, or having their lives ended - in-effect or materially due to wrongs; that, In my opinion, any good ‘ai ethics’ system - should have reasonable capacity to better understand, sooner.\n\nThe problem is that large entities do not make systems that expose them to legal repercussions willingly.  Consequently, these ‘mainframe’ like - money first policy framework, engenders a form of moral poverty that is, to me, simply detestable.  \n\nI hear from staff members of politicians offices; who suggest, nothing i’ve done has impacted ‘government policy’, whilst the fools are logging into systems that are being developed to in-part depend upon infrastructure that i was involved in creating, globally.  Yet, in my opinion, this isn’t about honesty, its about violence.  Systems that act violently as to in-turn prevoke violence, as the underlying series of assumptions are built upon the acceptability and barriers engendered to limit lawful recourse when persons are disaffected by [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]].  Whilst an extrodinary amount of effort may well see a person be able to have a problem that has been disaffecting them addressed; often, the apparent belief is that any such adjustment should in and of itself be considered lawful remedy, regardless of the broader repercussions any such wrongs may have had upon the target of wrong-doings and/or the intentional employment of [[SocialAttackVectors]] because of how AI is designed to support some [[SafetyProtocols]] without any form of meaningful support for others, including some of those defined already in these documents. \n\n*Notably also; During the course of my R&D works in relation to these ecosystems, it has been made apparent to me that they are less likely to engage in wrong-doing when dealing with professional criminals.  It has been suggested to me, that they prefer to target law abiding citizens because its far easier than targeting criminals, who have advanced their skills as a requirement relating to their profession as a criminal. In-effect, that they’re too hard to sort out; so, they go after the good actors, who they know, they can assault without consequence because - they’re good actors, unwilling to break the law regardless of how it is these people, assault our values, as a society overall.*   \n\nSo.  \n\n### Defining 'Human-Centric Ai Ethics'\n\nThe implication for defining “Human Centric Ai Ethics’ relates to the [[Centricity]] considerations in addition to broader[[WebScience]] considerations; when modelling [[ArtificialMinds]] as to support ‘reality check tech’. Human Centric AI is for those who want to build solutions that improve our capacity to sort out bad actors via courts; via the production of solutions that provide ‘democratisation’ of electronic evidence. This in-turn supports foundational requirements considered necessary in-order to support the ability to do real-world ‘ai ethics’ in ways that was previously impossible as a consequence of designs. \n\nWebizen systems are different to modern global cloud 'Mainframes', that are built to support the requirements of rulers - not rights, human rights or other words; has nothing to do with ‘ethics’ in a world, that is said to be about building peace infrastructure.  \n\n*The video below provides a very quick summary of the difference between rights and rulers.*\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRGhrYmUjU4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n### Economic Benefits of Ethics for Moral Economy Systems\n\nSystems, that are designed to support acts of violence with legal impunity, due to structure of systems designs; and other political-sciences related manoeuvres, don’t cost less. Rather, there is a propensity to engender or employ various types of [[SocialAttackVectors]] in an effort to negate responsibility for whatever the underlying problem actually is; terms that describe these sorts of behaviours include \"passing the buck\" and obstruction.  Innately, these sorts of behaviours incur additional costs whilst failing to deliver an outcome that needs to be resolved in some way, even if the outcome that is engendered is that the victim ends-up dead.  When these sorts of things are exacted upon persons, it has a ripple effect acrooss a multitude of persons, and overall - doesn't improve productivity, support human rights or increase the capacity for gainful revenues to become developed via the success of policies relating to [[SocialFactors]].\n\n## What is Ethics? \n\nIn the diagram, produced in 2018, as provided below; the distinction between 'moral responsibility' and 'ethical responsibility' is illustrated. \n\n![[2018-9TheCollectiveInfoSphere.webp]]\n\n![[1_iGzdEyUWAzT7TDjU6IUvTQ.webp]]\n\n\nTherein - the distinction becomes one where every individual human being owns the moral responsibility that is associated to his or her actions; yet, in a group situation, the utility of that moral responsibility to make their own personal choices in any given situation may not result in an outcome that is consistant with their view; as such, the prevailing outcome is considered to be the representation of a groups ethical responsibilities. \n\nAs a consequence of there being very little support for individuals (or indeed also, lawful remedy in relation to wrong-doings); there are various distortive effects upon 'ethics' generally, and in-turn also those that relate to the creation of active software agents, that we manifestly call - Artificial Intelligence or AI.  \n\n## The Webizen Difference\n\nThrough the use or application of 'AI Ethics' in relation to Webizen ecosystems, ‘ethics’ or various values statements that are said to be the guiding instruments bound to their terms of employment; are in-turn subject to semantic ecosystems that ensure they’re not provided the right to assault the human rights of children, or their loved ones as to exploit children. \n\nActions that may be considered to be part of a persons authorised behaviours in connection with an employment contract that may seek otherwise, to provide impunity without insurable (or uninsurable) risk / liability - becomes contextualised via the ability of others to seek lawful consideration via courts of law.  \n\nSo the benefit, of webizen, for people who actually care about ‘ethics’ or moral equities, socio-economic systems, solutions and the means to use technology as a series of tools to support the interests of our human family; is that through means, to democratise ‘ai servers’ so that there’s a means to include, consideration for natural justice, for the needs, rights, values and considerations of importance for natural persons, in their private capacity; regardless of any other role they may hold in our societies, that there’s now a technical means to figure out how it is, we’re able to make them more meaningful than before.\n\nAs such, new opportunities become available to form more appropriate approaches that can better support the common understanding of what terms like 'ethics' should mean, particularly in relation to public policy and related (endorsed) public / private sector activities."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/ChatGPT/ChatGPT-DynamicOntology/","title":"ChatGPT-DynamicOntology"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"## Dynamic Ontology\n\nThe below text is sourced via the Q&A with ChatGPT to figure out how to create a dynamic ontology solution.

I don't like OWL being used for human beings and as a means to describe parts of our biosphere that is not property of a company, but rather something that is of earth. To address this problem, i am trying to figure out how to create a machine-learning training program, that would be provided an english language dictionary, including information about the use of words in the context of them being used as a NOUN, PRONOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVE, ADVERB, PREPOSITION, CONJUNCTION or INTERJECTION and related descriptions of the definition provided using the english language. The program would process this information and provide a model that can be used for the purpose of defining a top-level ontology that can be used with RDF and RDFS for the creation of RDF ontologies. How can this be achieved?\n\nChatGPT:\n\nThere are several ways to approach this problem of creating a machine-learning training program that can process an English language dictionary and provide a model for defining a top-level ontology that can be used with RDF and RDFS. One approach would be to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically extract information about the usage and meaning of words in the dictionary.\n\nOne specific method to achieve this would be to use a supervised machine learning algorithm, such as a neural network. This would involve training the algorithm on a large dataset of labeled examples of text, where the label is the part of speech (e.g. noun, verb, adjective) and its definition. The algorithm would learn to predict the part of speech and definition based on the input text.\n\nAnother approach would be to use unsupervised learning methods such as topic modeling, where the algorithm would be able to identify the latent topics represented by the words and its definition.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that this is a big task and it would require a lot of computational power and time to process the data, and might require a team of experts in the field of NLP and machine learning to implement it.\n\nOnce you have the model, it can be used to automatically classify new words and phrases and generate the top-level ontology for RDF and RDFS. This would allow you to automatically generate RDF ontologies that are more accurate and comprehensive than those created by manual annotation.\n\nAnother approach to achieve this would be to use a combination of rule-based and machine learning methods. In this approach, a set of rules would be manually defined to extract information about the usage and meaning of words in the dictionary. These rules would be based on the grammar and syntax of the English language, and would be used to identify and classify words based on their part of speech and definition.\n\nThe rule-based system would be used as a pre-processing step to extract the information, and then a machine learning model would be trained on this pre-processed data to improve the accuracy of the classification.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that it's important to have a large, diverse and representative dataset to train the model on, so that the model can generalize well to unseen data.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider using pre-trained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-3, etc, that have been trained on large amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned to perform the specific task of part-of-speech tagging and definition extraction.\n\nOnce you have the model, it can be used to automatically classify new words and phrases and generate the top-level ontology for RDF and RDFS.

For example, it's possible to use probability distributions to model the likelihood of different words appearing in a given context, and to use statistical methods to analyze the relationships between different words and their meanings.\n\nAnother way to express the English vocabulary mathematically is by using formal language theory, which is a branch of theoretical computer science. Formal languages are a mathematical abstraction of natural languages and can be described using mathematical notation, such as regular expressions, context-free grammars, and formal languages. These formal languages provide a mathematical framework for describing the syntax and structure of natural languages.\n\nAdditionally, it's possible to use mathematical models such as vector spaces and tensor representations to represent words and phrases, and to use mathematical operations such as matrix multiplication and dot product to perform operations such as similarity, analogy, and relationship between words.\n\nIn summary, while it's possible to express the English vocabulary mathematically to some extent, natural language is a complex phenomenon and not all aspects of it can be fully captured by mathematical representation, and it's important to use a combination of mathematical and computational models to represent natural languages.\n\n***My Question: What are the ontological rules for the english language?***\n\nOntological rules are guidelines for organizing and structuring knowledge in a specific domain. In the context of the English language, ontological rules would be guidelines for how to organize and structure the vocabulary and grammar of the language in a consistent and logical way.\n\nThere are several different ontological frameworks that have been proposed for the English language. Some examples include:\n\n1.  [WordNet](http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/): This is a lexical database that organizes English words into sets of synonyms (synsets) and describes the relationships between them. WordNet provides a hierarchical structure for the English vocabulary, with nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs arranged in a tree-like structure.\n    \n2.  [FrameNet](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/): This is a lexical database that organizes English words into frames, which are sets of words that are related to a specific concept or event. FrameNet provides a way to organize the English vocabulary based on the roles that words play in different situations.\n    \n3.  [Cyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc): This is a large-scale ontology that organizes knowledge about the world in a hierarchical and logical way. Cyc includes a large number of concepts and relations, and provides a framework for organizing the English vocabulary in a consistent and logical way.\n\n4.  [SUMO](https://www.ontologyportal.org/): This is a large-scale ontology that organizes knowledge in a hierarchical and logical way. SUMO provides a framework for organizing the English vocabulary in a consistent and logical way, and includes a large number of concepts and relations.\n\nImageSource: [Ontology Portal](https://www.ontologyportal.org/)\n\n\n5.  OntoWordNet: This is an ontology that is based on WordNet, but it provides a more formal and logical structure for the English vocabulary. It organizes words in a hierarchical structure and provides formal definitions and axioms for the concepts represented by the words.\n    \n6.  The General English Ontology (GEO): This is an ontology that provides a general structure for organizing the English vocabulary in a consistent and logical way. The GEO provides a high-level structure for organizing concepts and relationships, and it has been used in a variety of NLP and AI applications.\n    \n7.  The OpenCyc: An open-source version of the Cyc ontology, it's a large-scale ontology that organizes knowledge about the world in a hierarchical and logical way. It includes a large number of concepts and relations, and provides a framework for organizing the English vocabulary in a consistent and logical way.\n    \n\nIt's important to note that these ontologies and frameworks are not mutually exclusive and they can work together in a complementary way. Additionally, these ontologies are continuously being updated and improved by the community of researchers and practitioners.\n\nIn summary, ontological rules for the English language are guidelines for organizing and structuring the vocabulary and grammar of the language in a consistent and logical way. There are different ontological frameworks that have been proposed for the English language, such as WordNet, FrameNet, Cyc, SUMO, OntoWordNet, GEO, and OpenCyc, each with its own strengths and weaknesses and they are continuously being updated and improved by the community.\n\nIt's worth noting that these ontologies were created by experts in the field, and they are widely used in NLP and AI applications.\n\nIn summary, ontological rules for the English language are guidelines for organizing and structuring the vocabulary and grammar of the language in a consistent and logical way, and there are different ontological frameworks that have been proposed for the English language such as WordNet, FrameNet, Cyc, SUMO, etc.\n\n\nNOTES:\nOntoWordNet LINKS\nhttps://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2005Feb/0066.html\nhttps://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/WNET/\nhttp://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/\nOther links\nhttps://babelnet.org/\n\nhttps://github.com/ontologyportal/sumo\n\nhttp://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/about \nhttp://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/\n\nhttps://old.datahub.io/dataset/opencyc is unavailable;  a version of it has been found: https://github.com/asanchez75/opencyc/blob/master/opencyc-latest.owl.gz \n\nnoteAlso: https://www.wordsapi.com/\n\n\n\n***My Question: \nnote; my objective is to specifically seek to maintain the proper use of terms defined using english words. This is distinct to the creation of software that might seek to support NLP related processes for sentences and broader documents. Now Therefore; When defining a high-level schema to describe the logical use of an english term or a group of english terms that are used in camelCase to define an ontological class, subclass, property, relation or datatype; what terms should be used to define the logical use of english terms for the purpose of defining an RDFS ontology document?***\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\nWhen defining a high-level schema to describe the logical use of English terms for the purpose of defining an RDFS ontology document, it's important to use terms that are clear, consistent, and aligned with existing ontologies and standards.\n\nHere are some terms that you may consider using when defining the schema:\n\n1.  Class: A class is a category of things or concepts that share common characteristics. In the context of an RDFS ontology, classes are used to group together resources that have similar properties and relationships.\n    \n2.  Subclass: A subclass is a category of things or concepts that are more specific than a general class. In the context of an RDFS ontology, subclasses are used to group together resources that have more specific properties and relationships than a general class.\n    \n3.  Property: A property is a characteristic or attribute of a class or individual resource. In the context of an RDFS ontology, properties are used to describe the relationships between classes and individuals.\n    \n4.  Relation: A relation is a connection or association between classes or individuals. In the context of an RDFS ontology, relations are used to describe the relationships between classes and individuals.\n    \n5.  Datatype: A datatype is a specific type of data, such as a string, integer, or date. In the context of an RDFS ontology, datatypes are used to specify the type of data that a property can hold.\n    \n6.  URI: A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string of characters that identify a name or a resource on the Internet. In the context of an RDFS ontology, URIs are used to identify and reference classes, properties, and individuals in the ontology.\n    \n7.  RDFS: RDF Schema is a set of classes and properties that provide a vocabulary for expressing constraints on RDF statements.\n    \n\nIt's also important to note that when defining the schema, you should use camelCase to define the ontological class, subclass, property, relation, or datatype, as it's one of the conventions followed in RDFS ontologies.\n\nIn summary, when defining a high-level schema to describe the logical use of English terms for the purpose of defining an RDFS ontology document, it's important to use terms such as Class, Subclass, Property, Relation, Datatype, URI, RDFS and to use camelCase to define the ontological class, subclass, property, relation, or datatype.\n\nAnother important aspect to consider when defining the high-level schema is to align it with existing ontologies and standards. This will make it easier to integrate the ontology with other systems and to ensure that it is consistent with the existing knowledge representation practices.\n\nSome examples of existing ontologies and standards that you may consider aligning your schema with include:\n\n-   OWL (Web Ontology Language): OWL is a standard for representing ontologies on the web. It provides a rich set of constructs for describing classes, properties, individuals, and relationships.\n    \n-   RDF (Resource Description Framework): RDF is a standard for representing information on the web. It provides a way to describe resources and their relationships in a machine-readable format.\n    \n-   RDFS (RDF Schema): RDFS is a standard for defining vocabularies and constraints on RDF statements. It provides a set of classes and properties that can be used to define the structure of an ontology.\n    \n-   SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System): SKOS is a standard for representing knowledge organization systems, such as thesauri, taxonomies, and other types of controlled vocabularies.\n    \n-   DC (Dublin Core): DC is a set of 15 properties that can be used to describe resources in a simple, standard way.\n    \n\nBy aligning the schema with existing ontologies and standards, you can ensure that the ontology is consistent with the existing knowledge representation practices and it can be easily integrated with other systems.\n\nIn summary, when defining a high-level schema to describe the logical use of English terms for the purpose of defining an RDFS ontology document, it's important to use terms such as Class, Subclass, Property, Relation, Datatype, URI, RDFS and to use camelCase to define the ontological class, subclass, property, relation, or datatype. Additionally, aligning the schema with existing ontologies and standards can ensure that the ontology is consistent with the existing knowledge representation practices and it can be easily integrated with other systems.\n\nThe only existing ontologies and standards that i want to align the method with is RDF and RDFS. In this case, describe an ontology that provides the constructs for describing the logic of an english dictionary in N3\n\n\nAn ontology that provides the constructs for describing the logic of an English dictionary in N3 (Notation3) using RDF and RDFS could be organized as follows:\n\n1.  Classes: The ontology would define classes for different types of words, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. These classes would be used to group together resources that have similar properties and relationships.\n    \n2.  Properties: The ontology would define properties for describing the characteristics of words, such as their part of speech, definition, and examples of usage. These properties would be used to describe the relationships between classes and individuals.\n    \n3.  Relations: The ontology would define relations for describing the connections or associations between words, such as synonyms and antonyms. These relations would be used to describe the relationships between classes and individuals.\n    \n4.  Individuals: The ontology would define individuals for each word in the dictionary, with each individual having properties such as part of speech, definition, and examples of usage.\n    \n5.  RDFS: The ontology would use RDFS to define the class hierarchy, properties and restrictions.\n    \n\nHere is an example of how a word \"Apple\" could be represented in N3 using RDF and RDFS:\n\n```\n@prefix rdf: [http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#) . @prefix rdfs: [http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#) . @prefix dic: [http://example.com/dictionary#](http://example.com/dictionary#) .\n\n```\n\ndic:Apple a dic:Noun ; rdfs:label \"Apple\" ; dic:definition \"a round fruit with a red, green or yellow skin and a core of small seeds in the middle\" ; dic:example \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\" .\n\nIn this example, the class \"Noun\" is defined as a subclass of rdfs:Class, the individual \"Apple\" is defined as an instance of the class \"Noun\", and it has properties such as definition and example of usage. The prefix dic: is used to identify the namespace of the ontology, and the properties and classes are defined using the dic: namespace.\n\nAdditionally, the ontology could include additional classes and properties to represent more specific information about the words, such as the tense of verbs, singular and plural forms of nouns, comparative and superlative forms of adjectives, etc.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, in order to make the ontology more expressive, it can use some additional RDFS constructs such as RDFS:subClassOf, RDFS:domain, RDFS:range, RDFS:subPropertyOf, etc.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that RDF and RDFS are quite flexible and can be used to represent a wide range of different ontologies and vocabularies. Therefore, you may want to consider consulting existing ontologies and vocabularies, such as WordNet, FrameNet, and others, to identify the best practices and common patterns for representing the logic of an English dictionary.\n\nIn summary, an ontology that provides the constructs for describing the logic of an English dictionary in N3 using RDF and RDFS could be organized by defining classes for different types of words, properties for describing the characteristics of words, relations for describing the connections between words, individuals for each word in the dictionary, and using RDFS to define the class hierarchy, properties, and restrictions. Additionally, it can use additional RDFS constructs and also aligning with existing ontologies and standards can help to make the ontology more expressive and consistent.\n\n***My Question: provide a code example in turtle***\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix dic: <http://example.com/dictionary#> .\n\ndic:Word rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .\ndic:Noun rdfs:subClassOf dic:Word .\ndic:Verb rdfs:subClassOf dic:Word .\ndic:Adjective rdfs:subClassOf dic:Word .\ndic:Adverb rdfs:subClassOf dic:Word .\n\ndic:partOfSpeech rdfs:domain dic:Word ;\n                  rdfs:range rdfs:Literal .\ndic:definition rdfs:domain dic:Word ;\n                rdfs:range rdfs:Literal .\ndic:example rdfs:domain dic:Word ;\n                rdfs:range rdfs:Literal .\n\ndic:synonym rdfs:domain dic:Word ;\n                rdfs:range dic:Word .\n\ndic:Apple a dic:Noun ;\n\n```\n\n***My Question:\nhow can multiple prefixes for the same ontological asset be defined so that the ontology document can be provided over multiple protocols (ie: IPFS, WebTorrent, etc) whilst providing the semantic RDF RDFS requirements to define that the document URIs are referring to the same document?***\n\nChatGPT Response:\n\nWhen defining an ontology that will be provided over multiple protocols, such as IPFS and WebTorrent, it's important to ensure that the URIs used to reference the ontology document are consistent across all protocols. One way to achieve this is to use multiple prefixes for the same ontological asset, and to define them in such a way that they all refer to the same document.\n\nHere are a few ways to achieve this:\n\n1.  Use a single prefix and different URI schemes: You can use a single prefix and define different URI schemes for the same ontological asset. For example, you can use the prefix \"dic:\" to refer to the ontology, and then define the URIs as \"dic:Apple\" for the web, \"ipfs:Qm1234567890\" for IPFS, and \"webtorrent:abcdefgh\" for WebTorrent.\n    \n2.  Use multiple prefixes and same URI scheme: You can use multiple prefixes for the same ontological asset, and define them to use the same URI scheme. For example, you can use the prefix \"dic:\" for the web, \"ipfs_dic:\" for IPFS, and \"webtorrent_dic:\" for WebTorrent and then define the URIs as \"dic:Apple\" for the web, \"ipfs_dic:Apple\" for IPFS, and \"webtorrent_dic:Apple\" for WebTorrent.\n    \n3.  Linked Data Fragments (LDF) : It's a set of conventions that allows to define multiple URIs for the same resource, which can be identified by different access methods. With LDF, you can use the same URI as the representation of the resource, and it will redirect to the appropriate access method.\n    \n4.  Use 303 redirection: Use the HTTP 303 status code to redirect requests for the ontology to the appropriate location, depending on the protocol being used. This allows you to use a single URI for the ontology, but redirect requests to the appropriate location based on the protocol being used.\n    \n\nIn summary, when defining an ontology that will be provided over multiple protocols, it's important to ensure that the URIs used to reference the ontology document are consistent across all protocols. This can be achieved by using a single prefix and different URI schemes, using multiple prefixes and same URI scheme, using Linked Data Fragments, or using HTTP 303 redirection.\n\n***My question: Provide an example in turtle***\n\n```turtle\n\n@prefix dic: <http://example.com/dictionary#> .\n@prefix ipfs_dic: <ipfs:Qm1234567890/dictionary#> .\n@prefix webtorrent_dic: <webtorrent:abcdefgh/dictionary#> .\n\ndic:Apple a dic:Noun ;\n    rdfs:label \"Apple\" ;\n    dic:definition \"a round fruit with a red, green or yellow skin and a core of small seeds in the middle\" ;\n    dic:example \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\" .\n\nipfs_dic:Apple owl:sameAs dic:Apple .\nwebtorrent_dic:Apple owl:sameAs dic:Apple .\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the same class \"Apple\" is defined using three different prefixes \"dic:\", \"ipfs_dic:\", and \"webtorrent_dic:\", but they refer to the same resource. Then we use the owl:sameAs property to indicate that those resources are the same.\n\nThis way, when the ontology is accessed over IPFS, the URI \"ipfs_dic:Apple\" can be used to reference the class, and when accessed over WebTorrent, the URI \"webtorrent_dic:Apple\" can be used instead. And, when accessed over the web, the URI \"dic:Apple\" can be used.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, when using the owl:sameAs property, the ontology will be consistent with OWL 2 standard and it will be able to indicate that resources are identical.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an example, and the URIs used in the example are not valid and it's just for illustration purposes.\n\n***My Question:\nwhat is a solution that provides the ability to define an ontology document as a version that relates to a collection of ontology documents about the same topic. For example; when seeking to describe a law or legislation, the law may change and the ontology document may be only relavent within a particular period of time. So, in turtle, i want to describe a topic collection (ie: a legislative instrument) and relate versions as described in RDF to specific periods of time and provide an ontological reference to the latest version of that document. How could this be achieved? Provide a solution in turtle***\n\nChatGPT Answer:\nIn order to define an ontology document as a version that relates to a collection of ontology documents about the same topic, such as a legislative instrument, you can use the RDF and RDFS constructs to describe the topic collection and relate versions to specific periods of time. Here's an example of how this could be achieved in Turtle:\n\n```Turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix law: <http://example.com/legislation#> .\n@prefix time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#> .\n\nlaw:LegislativeInstrument rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .\nlaw:Version rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .\n\nlaw:hasVersion rdfs:domain law:LegislativeInstrument ;\n               rdfs:range law:Version .\n\nlaw:validFrom rdfs:domain law:Version ;\n               rdfs:range time:Instant .\n\nlaw:validTo rdfs:domain law:Version ;\n               rdfs:range time:Instant .\n\nlaw:latestVersion rdfs:domain law:LegislativeInstrument ;\n               rdfs:range law:Version .\n\nlaw:LegislativeInstrument1 a law:LegislativeInstrument ;\n    rdfs:label \"Legislative Instrument 1\" ;\n    law:hasVersion law:Version1, law:Version2, law:Version3 .\n\nlaw:Version1 a law:Version ;\n    rdfs:label \"Version 1\" ;\n    law:validFrom \"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z\"^^time:Instant ;\n    law:validTo \"2022-12-31T23:59:59Z\"^^time:Instant .\n\nlaw:Version2 a law:Version ;\n    rdfs:label \"Version 2\" ;\n    law:validFrom \"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z\"^^time:Instant ;\n    law:validTo \"2023-12-31T23:59:59Z\"^^time:Instant .\n\nlaw:Version3 a law:Version ;\n    rdfs:label \"Version 3\" ;\n    law:validFrom \"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\"^^time:Instant ;\n    law:validTo \"2024-12-31T23:59:59Z\"^^time:Instant .\n\nlaw:LegislativeInstrument1 law:latestVersion law:Version3 .\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the class \"LegislativeInstrument\" is defined as a subclass of \"Resource\", and the class \"Version\" is defined as a subclass of \"Resource\" as well. The property \"hasVersion\" is defined to relate the \"LegislativeInstrument\" class with the \"Version\" class. The property \"validFrom\" and \"validTo\" are defined to indicate the time range when the version is valid. Finally, the property \"latestVersion\" is used to indicate the latest version of the legislative instrument.\n\nHere, the specific legislative instrument \"LegislativeInstrument1\" is defined with three versions \"Version1\", \"Version2\" and \"Version3\". Each version is defined with properties \"validFrom\" and \"validTo\" indicating the time range when the version is valid. The latest version \"Version3\" is indicated using the property \"latestVersion\".\n\nThis way, by using the RDF and RDFS constructs, you can describe the topic collection of a legislative instrument and relate versions to specific periods of time. And also, you can specify the latest version of that document and it will be easy to identify it.\n\nIt's worth noting that in this example, I've used the time ontology (time:) to define the time range but you can use other ways to represent time, such as using xsd:dateTime.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this is an example, and the URIs and values used in the example are not valid and it's just for illustration purposes.\n\n***My Question:\nhow can a cryptographic signature be generated on an RDF document to enable a parser to validate whether or not the document has been altered?***\n\nA cryptographic signature can be generated on an RDF document to enable a parser to validate whether or not the document has been altered, by using a digital signature algorithm. A digital signature algorithm, such as RSA or ECDSA, can be used to create a digital signature of the RDF document.\n\nHere's an example of how this could be achieved in Turtle:\n\n```turtle\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix sig: <http://example.com/signature#> .\n\nsig:Signature rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .\nsig:signatureValue rdfs:domain sig:Signature ;\n                  rdfs:range xsd:base64Binary .\n\ndc:creator sig:signatureValue \"base64 encoded signature value\" .\ndc:date \"2022-09-20T19:20:30-05:00\"^^xsd:dateTime .\n\n```\n\nIn this example, we defined a new class \"Signature\" as a subclass of \"Resource\" and the property \"signatureValue\" which is defined to relate the \"Signature\" class with the value of the signature, which is represented as xsd:base64Binary. Additionally, we use dc:creator and dc:date properties to indicate the signature creator and the date when the signature was generated.\n\nThis way, the parser can use the public key of the signature creator to verify the signature value, and check if the document has been altered.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that this is just an example, and in real-world scenarios, the signature should be generated using proper libraries and tools that implement the desired digital signature algorithm. And also it's important to use secure key management techniques to protect the private key.\n\n**my Question;\nHow do i define a cuDNN training model to process an english dictionary for the purpose of using the vocabulary to define RDF / RDFS ontologies, that do not use OWL**\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\nThe cuDNN library is a GPU-accelerated library for deep neural networks, and it can be used to train models for various tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n\nTo define a cuDNN training model to process an English dictionary for the purpose of using the vocabulary to define RDF/RDFS ontologies, you would need to:\n\n1.  Prepare the data: This would involve preprocessing the English dictionary to extract the vocabulary and related information such as part of speech, definition, etc. and format it into a format suitable for training a neural network.\n    \n2.  Define the model architecture: This would involve choosing a suitable model architecture that can handle the task of vocabulary extraction, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer-based model.\n    \n3.  Train the model: This would involve using cuDNN to train the model on the preprocessed data, using techniques such as backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.\n    \n4.  Use the trained model: Once the model is trained, you can use it to extract vocabulary from new texts and use it to define RDF/RDFS ontologies.\n    \n\nIt's worth noting that creating an ontology from text is a complex task, and the final ontology will depend on the specific use case and the ontology model that you choose to represent the vocabulary. Additionally, it's also important to note that using cuDNN for this task is not the most common way, as it's a powerful library that is mostly used for deep learning tasks. There are other libraries and models that might be more suitable for this kind of task, like word2vec, GloVe, or BERT.\n\n\n\n**My Question:\n*provide an example of preparing hte data in golang and include the syntactic field to define \"parts of speech\" to distinguish whether a word definition relates to the use of that word in the form of a NOUN, PRONOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVE, ADVERB, PREPOSITION, CONJUNCTION or INTERJECTION.***\n\nHere's an example of how you could prepare the data in Go for a model that aims to distinguish whether a word definition relates to the use of that word in the form of a NOUN, PRONOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVE, ADVERB, PREPOSITION, CONJUNCTION or INTERJECTION:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\ntype Vocab struct {\n    Word       string `json:\"word\"`\n    POS        string `json:\"pos\"`\n    Definition string `json:\"definition\"`\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    // load the english dictionary\n    file, _ := os.Open(\"english_dictionary.json\")\n    defer file.Close()\n\n    var dictionary map[string]interface{}\n    json.NewDecoder(file).Decode(&dictionary)\n\n    // create a slice to store the vocabulary and related information\n    var vocab []Vocab\n\n    // iterate over the dictionary entries\n    for word, entry := range dictionary {\n        pos := entry.(map[string]interface{})[\"pos\"].(string)\n        definition := entry.(map[string]interface{})[\"definition\"].(string)\n\n        // add the vocabulary and related information to the vocab slice\n        vocab = append(vocab, Vocab{Word: word, POS: pos, Definition: definition})\n    }\n\n    // save the vocab slice to a file for training\n    vocabFile, _ := os.Create(\"vocab.json\")\n    defer vocabFile.Close()\n\n    json.NewEncoder(vocabFile).Encode(voc\n\n```\n\n**ChatGPT Question:\nProvide me an example of how to do step 2, using that model in golang using cuDNN**\n\nChatGPT Answer\nStep 2 of defining a cuDNN training model to process an English dictionary for the purpose of using the vocabulary to define RDF/RDFS ontologies, would involve defining the model architecture.\n\nHere's an example of how you could define a model architecture in Go using cuDNN:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"github.com/dereklstinson/GoCUDA\"\n    \"github.com/dereklstinson/GoCUDA/cudnn\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // create a cudnn handle\n    handle, _ := cudnn.Create()\n    defer handle.Destroy()\n\n    // define the model architecture\n    // here we will use a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer\n    inputTensor, _ := cudnn.CreateTensorDescriptor()\n    defer inputTensor.Destroy()\n    inputTensor.Set(cudnn.DataTypeFloat, []int32{batchSize, inputSize}, []int32{inputSize, 1})\n\n    hiddenTensor, _ := cudnn.CreateTensorDescriptor()\n    defer hiddenTensor.Destroy()\n    hiddenTensor.Set(cudnn.DataTypeFloat, []int32{batchSize, hiddenSize}, []int32{hiddenSize, 1})\n\n    outputTensor, _ := cudnn.CreateTensorDescriptor()\n    defer outputTensor.Destroy()\n    outputTensor.Set(cudnn.DataTypeFloat, []int32{batchSize, outputSize}, []int32{outputSize, 1})\n\n    filterDesc, _ := cudnn.CreateFilterDescriptor()\n    defer\n    filterDesc.Set(cudnn.DataTypeFloat, []int32{hiddenSize, inputSize})\n\n    filterData, _ := GoCUDA.Malloc(filterDesc.Size())\n    defer filterData.Free()\n\n    biasDesc, _ := cudnn.CreateTensorDescriptor()\n    defer biasDesc.Destroy()\n    biasDesc.Set(cudnn.DataTypeFloat, []int32{hiddenSize}, []int32{hiddenSize, 1})\n\n    biasData, _ := GoCUDA.Malloc(biasDesc.Size())\n    defer biasData.Free()\n\n    // initialize the filter and bias data with random values\n    rand.Read(filterData.Pointer())\n    rand.Read(biasData.Pointer())\n\n    // create the feedforward neural network\n    _, _ = handle.CreateFeedForward(inputTensor, filterDesc, filterData, biasDesc, biasData, hiddenTensor, outputTensor)\n}\n\n```\n\nThis code snippet defines a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer, and creates a handle to interact with cuDNN library. It creates the tensor descriptor, filter descriptor, and bias descriptor for the input, hidden, and output layers respectively. It also initializes the filter and bias data with random values using the Go's math/rand package.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is just an example, and the actual model architecture will depend on the specific requirements of your use case, and it might require more complex architectures. Also, it's important to note that this example uses a library called GoCUDA which is a Go\n\n**My question: Provide an example of how to do step 3**\n\nStep 3 of defining a cuDNN training model to process an English dictionary for the purpose of using the vocabulary to define RDF/RDFS ontologies, would involve training the model using the preprocessed data.\n\nHere's an example of how you could train the model in Go using cuDNN:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"github.com/dereklstinson/GoCUDA\"\n    \"github.com/dereklstinson/GoCUDA/cudnn\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // create a cudnn handle\n    handle, _ := cudnn.Create()\n    defer handle.Destroy()\n\n    // load the preprocessed data\n    data, _ := GoCUDA.Malloc(dataSize)\n    defer data.Free()\n\n    labels, _ := GoCUDA.Malloc(labelSize)\n    defer labels.Free()\n\n    // set the data and labels\n    // ...\n\n    // set the training parameters\n    learningRate := 0.01\n    weightDecay := 0.0005\n    momentum := 0.9\n\n    // train the model\n    _, _ = handle.Train(data, labels, learningRate, weightDecay, momentum)\n}\n\n```\n\nThis code snippet loads the preprocessed data, which is the vocabulary and related information extracted from the English dictionary, and the corresponding labels (the part of speech) into memory, and sets the training parameters such as learning rate, weight decay, and momentum. It then uses the cuDNN library to train the model on the data.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a simplified example, and the actual training process will depend on the specific requirements of your use case and the model architecture. Also, it's important to note that this example uses a library called GoCUDA which is a Go library that provides bindings for CUDA, but it doesn't provide bindings for cuDNN library.\n\n**My question; provide an example of step 4**\n\nStep 4 of defining a cuDNN training model to process an English dictionary for the purpose of using the vocabulary to define RDF/RDFS ontologies, would involve evaluating the model's performance and fine-tuning it as necessary.\n\nHere's an example of how you could evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it in Go using cuDNN:\n\n```go\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"github.com/dereklstinson/GoCUDA\"\n    \"github.com/dereklstinson/GoCUDA/cudnn\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // create a cudnn handle\n    handle, _ := cudnn.Create()\n    defer handle.Destroy()\n\n    // load the test data\n    testData, _ := GoCUDA.Malloc(testDataSize)\n    defer testData.Free()\n\n    testLabels, _ := GoCUDA.Malloc(testLabelSize)\n    defer testLabels.Free()\n\n    // set the test data and labels\n    // ...\n\n    // evaluate the model's performance on the test data\n    accuracy, _ := handle.Evaluate(testData, testLabels)\n\n    // print the accuracy\n    println(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n\n    // fine-tune the model if necessary\n    if accuracy < desiredAccuracy {\n        // adjust the training parameters\n        learningRate *= 0.1\n        weightDecay *= 0.1\n\n        // retrain the model\n        _, _ = handle.Train(data, labels, learningRate, weightDecay, momentum)\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis code snippet loads test data and labels, and uses the cuDNN library to evaluate the model's performance on this test data. It then prints the accuracy, and if the accuracy is below a certain threshold, it adjusts the training parameters and retrains the model.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a simplified example, and the actual evaluation and fine-tuning process will depend on the specific requirements of your use case and the model architecture. Also, it's important to note that this example uses a library called GoCUDA which is a Go library that provides bindings for CUDA, but it doesn't provide bindings for cuDNN library.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are no Go libraries that provide bindings for cuDNN, which means that using cuDNN in Go is not a straightforward task, and it would require to use CGo to interact with the cuDNN C library, and this will require a deep understanding of both Go and C programming languages.\n\n\n### Review and considerations\n\n1. Its seemingly defined using tensorcores.  my laptop doesn't have tensor cores, only cudacores\n2.  I didn't know much about the existing solutions like wordnet.\n\n\n### Following-up\n\nOvernight, i found the various existing NLP libraries that were highlighted earlier, alongside a relatively easy to use example - [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/) that might be the best choice for producing a Proof of Concept to illustrate the general idea.   Yet, any overly simplified solution (as required to materialise something that demonstrates the general idea); will need an upgrade path.  Furthermore, the method of how to form a longer-term strategy is required.  \n\nIt is important to note (as i've started to illustrate [[RootConcepts]] ); that this underlying service MUST be able to be operated privately and in a stand-alone manner.  To achieve this solution, the outcome may be that the first time a topic or word is sought to be processed; an API call might be made to go and get the information that's required to be added to the database.  Presently, i'm unsure of the technical implications relating to any methods that are reasonably available to achieve that;  such as - can it run on a mobile phone or laptop?  etc.\n\nAs more work continues on the topic (the next day); the below 'work' was produced,\n\n#### ChatGPT\n\n**My Question:** what are the root languages for the english vocabulary?\n\n**ChatGPT Answer**:\nThe English vocabulary is made up of words borrowed from many different languages over the centuries. The main root languages of the English vocabulary are:\n\n-   Germanic: The Germanic languages, including Old English, are the most important source of words in English. They make up around 50% of the words in the English language. Words from Germanic languages include common words such as \"house,\" \"father,\" \"mother,\" \"man,\" \"woman,\" \"child,\" and \"dog.\"\n    \n-   Latin: Latin is the second most important source of words in English. Latin words make up around 30% of the English vocabulary. Many of these words are technical terms in fields such as science, medicine, and law. Words from Latin include \"hospital,\" \"doctor,\" \"university,\" \"species,\" \"algebra,\" \"formula,\" and \"jurisdiction.\"\n    \n-   French: French is the third most important source of words in English. French words make up around 10% of the English vocabulary. Many French words were borrowed during the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 and the following centuries of Norman rule. Words from French include \"money,\" \"art,\" \"government,\" \"justice,\" \"royalty,\" \"diamond,\" and \"restaurant.\"\n    \n-   Greek: Greek is the fourth most important source of words in English. Greek words make up around 5% of the English vocabulary. Many Greek words were borrowed through Latin, but some were borrowed directly into English. Words from Greek include \"philosophy,\" \"theology,\" \"anatomy,\" \"geometry,\" \"telephone,\" \"photograph,\" and \"encyclopedia.\"\n    \n\nOther languages that have contributed to the English vocabulary include Arabic, Italian, Spanish, and many others.\n\nIn addition to the root languages mentioned above, there are also many other languages that have contributed to the English vocabulary over time. These include:\n\n-   Arabic: Many Arabic words were borrowed into English through Latin and Greek. Words from Arabic include \"algebra,\" \"alcohol,\" \"candy,\" \"jar,\" \"lemon,\" \"magazine,\" \"sofa,\" \"sugar,\" and \"zero.\"\n    \n-   Italian: Words from Italian include \"balcony,\" \"broccoli,\" \"cappuccino,\" \"fiasco,\" \"gazebo,\" \"grotto,\" \"paparazzo,\" \"piano,\" \"sonata,\" and \"terrace.\"\n    \n-   Spanish: Words from Spanish include \"alligator,\" \"barbecue,\" \"bronco,\" \"chocolate,\" \"coyote,\" \"guerrilla,\" \"jaguar,\" \"mosquito,\" \"mustang,\" \"patio,\" \"siesta,\" \"sombrero,\" \"taco,\" and \"tornado.\"\n    \n-   Native American languages: Words from Native American languages include \"chocolate,\" \"chipmunk,\" \"moose,\" \"opossum,\" \"pecan,\" \"racoon,\" \"skunk,\" \"squash,\" \"tobacco,\" and \"tomato.\"\n    \n-   Asian languages: Words from Asian languages include \"bamboo,\" \"guru,\" \"karma,\" \"pajama,\" \"tycoon,\" \"yoga,\" and \"zen.\"\n    \n-   African languages: Words from African languages include \"banjo,\" \"jazz,\" \"okra,\" \"yam,\" and \"Zulu.\"\n    \n\nIt's worth noting that these are just a few examples of the many languages that have contributed to the English vocabulary over time. The English language is known for its rich history of borrowing words from other languages, and this is one of the reasons why it has such a diverse and dynamic vocabulary.\n\nMy question: provide an example relating to norse and old norse \n\nSure, here are a few examples of words that have been borrowed from Old Norse and Norse into the English language:\n\n-   \"Anguish\" comes from the Old Norse word \"angr\" meaning \"grief\" or \"sorrow.\"\n-   \"Berserk\" comes from the Old Norse word \"berserkr\" meaning \"a wild warrior.\"\n-   \"Bliss\" comes from the Old Norse word \"bliss\" meaning \"happiness.\"\n-   \"Eke\" means \"also\" or \"additionally\" comes from the Old Norse word \"eigi\" meaning \"also\" or \"in addition.\"\n-   \"Eg\" meaning \"I\" from Old Norse \"eg\"\n-   \"Fjord\" comes from the Old Norse word \"fjörðr\" meaning \"a narrow inlet of the sea.\"\n-   \"Knurl\" comes from the Old Norse word \"knurr\" meaning \"a small knot or knob.\"\n-   \"Mist\" comes from the Old Norse word \"mist\" meaning \"moisture.\"\n-   \"Ransack\" comes from the Old Norse word \"rannsaka\" meaning \"to search through.\"\n-   \"Scowl\" comes from the Old Norse word \"skul\" meaning \"a face with a frown.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that the Norse and Old Norse languages are closely related, and the vast majority of words borrowed into English from Old Norse came directly or indirectly from Norse. Norse is also known as Old Icelandic, it is a Germanic language that was spoken by the Vikings and other inhabitants of the Norse regions of Scandinavia and the North Atlantic islands in the Middle Ages.\n\n\n***My question: what benefit might the use of a neuromorphic processer provide for processing a natural language model?***  (note: that was part of the question)\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nA neuromorphic processor is a type of computer processor that is designed to mimic the way the human brain works. These processors use artificial neural networks, which are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, to perform tasks such as pattern recognition and decision-making.\n\nThe use of a neuromorphic processor for processing a natural language model could provide several benefits.\n\n-Neuromorphic processors are highly energy-efficient, which makes them well-suited for running large-scale natural language processing models on mobile or embedded devices.\n\n-Neuromorphic processors are also highly parallel, which means they can perform multiple computations simultaneously. This can lead to faster and more efficient processing of natural language models, as well as the ability to handle larger models.\n\n-Neuromorphic processors are also highly adaptable and can learn from new data, which means they can improve their performance over time. This can be particularly useful for natural language processing, as the meaning and usage of words and phrases can change over time, and a model that can adapt to these changes will be more accurate and useful.\n\n-Neuromorphic processors can also be more robust to noise, errors and variations in the data, which can be common in natural language data.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the field of neuromorphic computing and Neuromorphic processors are relatively new and still in development, and more research is needed to fully understand their potential benefits and limitations.\n\n***My Question: what is the earliest known time the english language was first used?***\n\nChatGPT: \n\nThe earliest known use of the English language dates back to the 5th century AD, when Germanic tribes, such as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, began to migrate to the island of Great Britain and settled there. These tribes spoke a Germanic language, which over time evolved into Old English.\n\nOld English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was the language spoken in England from the 5th century to the Norman conquest in 1066 AD. Old English is considered to be the earliest form of the English language, and it was written in the runic alphabet, which was later replaced by the Latin alphabet.\n\nOld English was a complex and inflected language, with a rich vocabulary and many grammatical features. However, it was quite different from the English spoken today and would be difficult for modern speakers to understand without study or translation.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes were not the only people that were in Great Britain during this time, there were also the Celts, and others, and they were speaking different languages, and the Germanic language of the invaders slowly replaced the Celtic languages and others, it took several centuries to form the language we know today as English."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/","title":"The Peace Infrastructure Project"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# The Peace Infrastructure Project\n\n### Peace Infrastructure Project History\n\nThe *Peace Infrastructure Project* was started in May / June 2022.  The objective originally described and circulated to Ministers, Government Representatives and others; was to create a project that was designed to manifest through the lens of creating a MegaFactory (or 'gigafactory') upon a productivity target of producing 1 million dwellings; something that was not seemingly considered at all by the government at the time.  \n\nThe main barrier that was not overcome; was that i created a presentation asking my Federal Government to produce a [GovTeams](https://govteams.gov.au/) Environment to support the development of an alliance framework with multiple parties; as to provide a safe environment before that was able to be formerally established.\n\nAfter a great deal of work on this project, and indeed also - a great deal of discouraging and fairly disparaging remarks, the federal budget was announced on the 25 October 2022; and in that announcement was some minor details for a plan that sought to produce a million houses and do so through a multi-stakeholder '*accord*'.  I then sought information about how this plan came about, as to seek to clarify how it was that something new was created that looked like my work - but government was unable to respond in any honourable manner..\n\nThe introduction to my long-form document, last edited on the 27th of August; starts as follows,\n\n*I don't know how / if i'll end-up being paid which is a problem that also dis-affects people who may also do useful work, but only be able to turn that into something that economically helps them - if they take the work somewhere else, to gain a benefit rather than living with the costs.  I am working to seek to address this problem, but it is a systemically difficult problem to resolve. This issue is part of the broader problem that acts to disaffect many - leading to negative impacts in other socio-economic areas, broadly.  Whilst there are ways this problem, and many others of a moral kind - can or could be addressed - the feasibility of doing so effectively, appears to harbour enormous costs.*  \n\n*The resilience of systems that knowingly exploit others for profit - referred to as #ScumbagTech or #ScumbagEconomics - is thriving at the moment.  It harms people, but the benefits for others are significant, and the implications of addressing known problem - also significant.* \n\n*This problem is seemingly not unlike issues of past where somehow - prior forms of slavery economics were overcome.  In our modern context, whilst the moral issues remain - the dynamics have changed.*\n\n*This is very illustrative of the broader, underlying problem.  This project isn’t simply about the production of a housing system, but moreover a commercially viable method to address the issue that People involved in #ScumbagTech can get a lot of work done for free, making false claims to being able to pay invoices in future… but that these methods are unsustainable, often unwanted & wrong.* \n\n*I’ve seen a lot of that in my time, but when competitively trying to go about an approach in a manner that seeks to maintain integrity, supporting the concept of ‘#realitychecktech’ and moral equity, etc.*  \n\n*It's very difficult to get much done at all given the status of technology, what is supported & what is not.  If you have any ideas about how I might be able to find some help to stitch this thing together quickly - that would be wonderful.  Ideally something is made - properly - comprehensible, prior to budget announcements.* \n\n*This body or work isn't about simply delivering 'social housing', rather, through the use of technology the purpose of it provides an opportunity to do something else, to support the growth of ‘social equity’, via a lens that seeks to consider that concept at multiple levels - including but not solely, economically. There are means to use the derivatives to support social housing, without forming a socialist agenda.*  \n\n*In seeking to get a grasp of the underlying notion, imagine if motor vehicles were only able to be made via expensive methods; and the solution put forward to industry was to serve the needs of those without financial means via government funding that provided them an economic opportunity to operate transportation for persons who cannot afford those expensive methods. The consequence of the automotive industry mass-producing vehicles and parts for both new and second-hand availability of motor vehicle transportation, was of instrumental importance to the development of our society's ability to feature a ‘middle class’.  Whilst the complexities of the modelling i am producing to illustrate the ‘how’ is different to what would make most sense in the early 1900s (motor vehicle industry emergence), an underlying way to get a grip on the proposed ramifications is no less significant, indeed, i’d argue that there’s far greater significance that can be yielded, should the work be employed with hygiene in an appropriate way.* \n\n*From a housing perspective - the most similar sort of thing I can find are factory built ‘foldable’ homes: Some examples of these sorts of systems include [Boxabl](https://www.boxabl.com/) and [Madihome](https://madihome.com/).*\n\n*These solutions are fundamentally different to the proposed housing system i am suggesting, could be brought about, subject to appropriate levels of capital, corporate structure & moral hygiene.*\n\n>The total length of this document is 271 pages, 85,301 words and only one of the broader array of documents, presentations, corraspondance and other works involved in seeking to produce an ecosystem that was in-turn designed to [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].  Sadly, it clearly didn't have the support of government policy as illustrated; and i do wonder how many houses they will require to be built for any such social housing agenda, given the implications.  Yet regardless, the broader body of the plan has; both, shifted, and in-turn also developed in a different kind of way - given the ramifications of the behaviours of others.\n\n>As may in-future be better explainable via [[ValuesCredentials]] and related Social Factors built into the [[PCT-WebizenTechStack]].\n\n### Peace Project Overview\nThe Overall goal of The Peace Infrastructure Project; is actually about rapidly producing the Biosphere & sociosphere infrstructure requirements billions of human beings across the planet need so desperately.  This would in-turn have a significant impact on our ability to deliver upon [[SustainableDevelopmentGoals(ESG)]] and in-turn; seek to do so much more.\n\nThere are many problems that exist with the idea of producing not simply 1 million modern dwellings; but moreover - a number that is likely to be much greater than 1 billion dwellings, and an unknown amount of earth and related ecosystems that are all inter-dependent.\n\nThe ability to consider the way to achieve these sorts of massive Humanitarian Objectives; is in-turn through a complex series of future works, that in-turnemploy [[BiosphereOntologies]] and Webizen 3.5 (AI empowered Hardware + AiOS) capabilities to produce the tooling we need; to figure out how it is that we design and bring about the best possible solutions, to improve the circumstances of all members of our human family world-wide.  In-effect, the underlying objective of [[Webizen]] and in-turn tools like the [[WorkProject]] built to function related ecosystem components and/or frameworks like the [[WebizenAlliance]] is designed to create a radically scalable productivity environment; that acts as an enabler to produce solutions that improve outcomes related to informatics systems. \nIn-turn, providing a capacity to produce foundational requirements related tol both the [[BiosphereOntologies]],  [[SocioSphereOntologies]] and consequentially thereafter also; [[SustainableDevelopmentGoals(ESG)]], [[ValuesCredentials]] and other metrics (IE: [[EnergyCalcs]] ) as is then able to be considered through the purposeful deliver of solutions that act to do such things as [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].\n\nIf we are unable to ensure [[CognitiveAI]] serves mankind, if the types of artificial minds that become universally promoted are in-fact those that prioritise support for #DigitalSlavery, #ScumbagEconomics , #ScumbagTech , if there are no alternatives that are provided the support needed to be brought about; then, there is no capacity to successfully deliver the sorts of peace infrastructure outcomes we need to advoid catastrophy.  Whilst some may not care or believe in any such sort of extostential threats; or consider that poor behaviour undertaken by them, for gainful purposes; may have far broader implications, then to some degree - there's not much that can be done about that.\n\nWhat should be possible, however, is to ensure those who think differently to those people, have a means to be provided the sorts of technological ecosystems needed, to improve the circumstances of both themselves and others; thoughout their lives, to the best of their abilities.   \n\nIndeed, those sorts of values are considered in many of the underlying instruments associated with [[ValuesProject]] and it is entirely understood that not all persons are appropriatelly equipped to play any form of meaningful role, or indeed also; maintain good standing in connection with the necessary protections required to support [[SafetyProtocols]] such as [[TheWebizenCharter]], the frameworks that will be defined by way of [[CommunityOfPractice]] methodologies and in-turn [[WebizenAlliance]] structures, rights, responsibilities and obligations.  Given these frameworks are all defined to support #RuleOflaw, it is hoped that there will not be any overwhelming objections raised by public officials in roles of trust and whom are in-turn obligated to support various [Values Credentials]] even though, they're only presently published in other types of electronic formats. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/Technologies/BackgroundToolsInfo/","title":"Background Re: Tools"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Background Re: Tools\n\n\nIn-order to understand what's going on here, there's a bunch of tools that are useful to be aware of generally.

So, the problem isn't so much about getting the data, its more about how to define the processes relating to the lifecycle use and availability of a complex model / system.\n\nIn terms of requirements; the most basic requirement is that it needs to operate on a mid-range consumer laptop and/or devices that are at least that powerful, understanding of course; that if its alot more powerful then that's not so much of a problem.\n\nThen the next issue is that there needs to be a foundational strategy for how to store and process the structured data.  The objective belief is that a quad-store approach is best, noting also that there's a new spec https://github.com/w3c/rdf-star-wg/ \n\nIF the SemWeb ecosystem is employed, it provides relatively standardised interfaces; so, whilst some parts may need to be implemented in a different language, etc.  that's thought to be less difficult than inventing some new series of methods, etc. \n\nYet, that means that the primary query interfaces are HTTP based; so, there's a bunch of stuff in there about the permissive commons stuff.  \n\n(which is where it starts to get more difficult). \n\nStreaming Quads / Data.\nAs the ecosystem grows, perhaps quickly, the ability to ensure the data is streamed or streamable is fairly important.  Then the means to seek to achieve a solution that can scale without the use of large cloud-platforms, becomes part of a broader p2p design.  \n\nThere probably needs to be some sort of 'curators', that should be loosely coupled (ie; not one big corporation) and provide meaningful support for local needs; which in-turn raises an array of important commercial issues, questions, business systems strategies & requirements.

GoFederatedLearning - A library for federated learning in Go. It provides a high-level API for building and training federated models, as well as tools for data privacy and security.\n    \n\nThese are just a few examples of the federated learning libraries available in Go. When choosing a library, it is important to consider factors such as compatibility with your existing tools and frameworks, ease of use, and community support.\n\nNOTE:  i think it just made that up...  But I found the python versions...\n\nhttps://github.com/intel/openfl\n\n\nSharding - thought i'd ask ChatGPT\n\nsharding can be applied to RNN, Graph RNN, CNN and other related models. Sharding refers to splitting a large model or dataset into smaller, manageable pieces called \"shards\". This can help to distribute the computational load and memory requirements of the model across multiple nodes, allowing for faster and more efficient training.\n\nFor example, in neural network models, the weights of the model can be split across multiple GPUs or nodes, each handling a portion of the computation during training. This allows for parallel processing, reducing the time it takes to train the model. The resulting weight updates can be combined to form the final model.\n\nIn RNNs and other sequence models, data can be split into smaller sequences and trained on separate nodes, with the final model being the average of the local models. However, this approach can lead to decreased accuracy in some cases, as the context information between the shards may be lost. To address this, more advanced sharding strategies, such as layer-wise or weight-wise sharding, can be used to balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.\n\nDataTypes considerations..\n\nGeospatial Co-ordinates and/or shapes (ie: areas)\n\nThis then associates with an array of place names, graphic markers, and other sorts of information. \n\nWhich is all measured against a timeline framework.\n\nThere's an issue with data-quality; there's going to be people who 'accidentially' (or intentionally and strategically) create or provide information that has poor data-hygiene (ie: its full of BS, perhaps BS that's very old). \n\nThen there is as consideration about 'chunking' and/or 'sharding' and/or other methods, that not-only relate to the computational process; but also, to the media type that's associated with the training process - or perhaps more accurately, the initialisation of the training process.\n\nThere needs to be a bunch of algorithms to solve 'optimization problems'.\n\nFuture tech:\n\nApproximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which can be used to optimize the parameters of a machine learning model.\n\nNeuromorphic algorithms include Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), Liquid State Machines (LSMs), and Neuromorphic Hardware Systems.\n\nWhich are amongst the things that are not expected to be readily available anytime soon.\n\nSo...\n\nI'll circle back in a tic.\n\nMy thinking is generally; leading me to consider, various older examples relating to P2P networks and how content can be distributed a bit like a swarm approach;  one example I am thoughtful of was called '[bitraider](https://web.archive.org/web/20100214004317/http://www.bitraider.com/)', yet the indice isn't simply about the distribution methodology, but also the ability to 'stream games' and other functional software (which, fwiw, goes back a bit earlier to [distream](https://web.archive.org/web/20041230121452/http://www.distream.com/), in that graphed example); nowtherefore, \n\nWhat i'm thinking about, is how to form what is in-effect a distributed computational network that is cooperatively operating, with strong 'Human Centric' controls, to support, a training model that uses chunks and/or sharding, and/or a multiplexer like approach to produce training model components; that are in-turn designed to render support for the optimisation and user-experience related issues; not unlike the sorts of problems that needed to be addressed in the early media / game encoding and streaming platforms.\n\n(next day)\n\nSO, i'm festering on how to describe the concepts associated with the; various complex stuff.  So, there needs to be a private agent.  \n\nhttps://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph is written in rust.  \n\nThere's various notes about the benefits of rust for memory-safe code...  \nhttps://asecuritysite.com/rust\n\nbut that's essentially at runtime. then the other implications is that part of what is required here, is the process of 'model construction', associated to the production of ontology; rather than more simply or perhaps as is better worded; procedurally, the consumption of it. \n\nHerein; still working on the 'optimisation' problems; i guess...  \n\nTherein also is the verifiability of the information such that it may be considered a form of electronic evidence rather than merely something of far less legal worth.\n\nATM: information and/or records about persons is stored in large 'silos', which have a different 'trust framework' associated to it; whilst the information stored in records may have the capacity to be changed in ways that are otherwise not reasonably able to be done by end-users (consumers) these sorts of qualities are then in-turn lost if the information is extracted from those platforms into a different system, that then in-turn has different properties / characteristics, etc. \n\nOne of the greater problems; relates to the tamper evidence or ability to reliably infer the content has not changed from the time-date stamp associated to the content artifact (unless the provider has changed the content); examples of where this considation applies include email and various social media systems - also document systems, etc.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_schema_theory\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/private-language/\nhttps://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html\nhttps://nautil.us/roger-penrose-on-why-consciousness-does-not-compute-236591/\n\n### Informatics theory\n\nThere's a standard developing called RDF Star.\nhttps://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/editors_draft.html\n\nA few years ago, i made a few notes about the concept of 'quins': https://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Public/search?keywords=quins \n\nThe core syntatic approach associates with a triple or quad; which is then extended via star, but there's two other factors at least - the first is signatures (decentralised validation schema of some sort); the second is temporal.  Overall the question that has an unknown answer, is about the dimensionality of the native structure, which thereafter needs to be mapped to RDF-star / Sparql-star compatible solutions (ideally also, convertable to other formats). \n\nNOTE:  write a call to action to seek AI specialists to write about the importance of Human Centric AI.  \n\nAlso note: need to define - What is Human Centric AI? \n\naspects of language, etc.\n\nMetaphysics"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/draftnotes/StreamingAiPackages/","title":"StreamingAiPackages"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"This note provides a description of the problem and related considerations; in association to a pursuit to figure out how to define a solution.  The concept currently labelled 'Streaming Ai Packages' is a foundational consideration about how to develop a foundational software environment that is designed to support Human Centric AI systems, with the sociosphere protections that are noted only briefly below.  More information about the sociosphere AI / Safety protocols are described elsewhere. \n\n### Laymens Explaination.\n\nIn the matrix, NEO sits on a chair and gets a package of information installed into his head.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_8NsPQBdV0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIn the models that are being produced to support 'Human Centric AI' the information isn't uploaded into a persons brain; but rather, into their 'Ai Agent', such as is described as Webizen or otherwise by others, overtime - if not apparent at the present time.  \n\nWhilst big global systems like the Chat interface provided by OpenAI are operating on big systems that have available to them lots of resources / servers;  Human Centric AI, in providing personal and private systems foundationally; as to thereafter support the use of AI systems with others, requires a means to get and process the information privately; prior to, thereafter being able to be instructed to initiate a sharing event, rather than a process where the thoughts must be shared prior to being able to 'think' about or 'do' anything at all.  \n\nThe global AI systems; are 'trained' (developed) in a way that seeks to cater for a vast array of different applications that it may be used for by whomever in the world makes use of it; and in-turn, provides to it all their thoughts and creative works, that is in-turn added to the 'hive mind' like model.   This is part of the reason why the models are so big; whilst the implication is also that they're very difficult for people to use independently due to the cost of deployment; particularly if they want it running on their own systems (privately).\n\nNow, in-order to produce the foundational requirements for the Webizen AI project and any other related project that may seek to employ the tooling for good / useful purposes, etc. there needs to be a way to process and support basic AI functions that are fundamentally based upon a means to process and respond to users in a manner that relates to the use of language; but moreover, there is a meaningful relationship between language and the development of our human civilisations.  Therein, the process of producing solutions that address language in particular; as is then better able to be used to construct models that use it as a dependency,  becomes a fairly large and complex system.\n\n### Basic Concept\n\nThe type of challenge that is presented when considering these problems is not unlike the sorts of issues that had to be contended with many years ago; in relation to streaming video and in-turn also, software / games.  Therein, the solution that was defined - in lay-speak, didn't require a person to download the entire video library in-order to watch one film; indeed it didn't even require a user to download the entire film, prior to being able to start watching it.  Whilst the nature of AI systems are not linear in the same way, I am now trying to work through the concept of how these sorts of ideas might apply to advaneced AI 'models' and indeed also, whether it is about 'one model' or a plurity of models or dynamic systems; that may have elements that are trained or compiled, whilst built with dependency models that are not.  Presently - i don't know, that's why i'm writing this note about it. \n\nI'll start with a summary overview for people who aren't good with these sorts of things; then, continue with my thinking atm, on the topic, after the introductory summary part of the note.\n\n\n## Background\n\nArtificial Intelligence systems are becoming increasingly visable in the public domain whilst the nature of their influence upon society remains largely unknown.  Whilst there are many exceptional scientists who have been working with Artificial Intelligence related technologies over many years, the ability to support private and personal AI services remains out of reach. \n\nWhat is AI? \n\nThere are many different types of technologies that are broadly provided the label 'AI\" or 'Artificial Intelligence'.  There is a continual propensity for users and creators alike, to seek to place upon these creative works; names relating to characteristics and/or functional behaviours that ordinarily associate with the namonclature related to descriptions about the being of humans and other natural life.  Many of the terms used, whilst sought to be considered on an endearing level; relate to various behavioural characteristics associated with consciousness and/or terminology associated with what is known to be part of 'being' and/or mind, in association to life; both as human beings, but also as is exhibited more broadly.  \n\nThe vast majority of 'AI' systems and/or technologies, do not make use of Quantum Computing hardware in any meaningful way; simply, because it is not yet commonly available and/or sufficiently evolved, at least not in any known commercial and/or non-military area.\n\nWhilst complex, the systems at a root-hardware layer rely upon semiconductors / transisters, which in-turn provides a programming layer via binary gates.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gUmDVe6C-BU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nArtificial Intelligence systems are generally implemented using software rather than hardware; although there are some exceptions, and here is resource that provides links to some of those examples,\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/sections/AICAS\n\nAn example of hardware implemented technology designed to assist AI software includes CUDA which is commonly associated with Graphics Cards, as well as TensorCores.  Emergent   Neuromorphic Circuits are becoming available, however they're not commonly available yet.\n\nFunctionally; most AI is software, and whilst it depends upon hardware, as does any form of software, the majority of the functionality is written as software code.  \n\nThere are many different catagories of \"AI\", which is why the term is considered by many to be a 'dirty term'.  Some of the top-level categories are;\n\n-   Neural Network \n-   Machine learning \n-   Deep learning \n\nAnd, there are many, many different sub-categories that exist within these fields alongside others that may be defined as being part of other different categories. \n\nThe main difference between software, that would otherwise be called software or software programs; and software, that is called 'AI' and has some sort of related functionality attributed to it, is that 'AI' algorithms are intended to produce a 'learning' *like* functional capacity in some way that provides usefulness - although, the latter concept (usefulness) may be subjectively determined.   None of these processes are able to occur without providing the software information, sensors and fundamentally therein - data.  The difference between data and information is subjective for human beings in similar yet different ways that have been applied to machines via the works broadly known as AI..\n\n### Information and DataTypes\n\nAI systems have and are being designed to consume an array of different types of information or data; ranging from images and image streams (video) audio, code and written languages.  One of the critical areas of importance is to distinguish un-structured data or information; from structured data, or information.  The latter employs various techniques to provide a labelling framework that is in-turn able to be used to provide classifications of the information provided to algorithms; in a way, that assists in algorithm development and use.\n\n### The World of Algorithms\n\nThe vast majority of what is defined as 'ai' is algorthms.  The combination of providing software algorithms information (structured, semi-structured, etc.) and enormous amounts of power (computational capabilities) is what ends-up defining the output that we call 'AI'. \n\nThese algorithms employ classical physics and mathematics to process vast amounts of information that has been produced and is available to the software to consume. \n\n### Cloud AIs\n\n\"Cloud Computing\" is effectively a nice way of defining a computing environment that connects users to computing resources that are most-often owned by some other party.  \n\nThese systems may be functionally supported by thousands to hundreds of thousands or more; computers, that are located in various places geographically.  Cloud AIs are software programs that exist on these massive systems; and are functionally 'owned' by the platform provider whilst engaged in communications activities via defined rules. \n\n### HumanCentric AIs\n\nA Human Centric AI is a form of AI that has been developed in a particular way to provide a range of different sorts of characteristics.  \n\nIt is able to;\n1. Be Beneficially owned by the human being it is intended to be used by. \n2. It is able to maintain secrecy of a persons own mindful activities; in so far as any such activities do not relate to any other person or entity in a way that may effect them.\n3. Maintain Permissions that have been applied between users when communications events relate to shared activities, events, works, etc.\n4. It is able to support SocioSphereAI requirements.\n\n### SocioSphereAI\n\nSocioSphere AI functions and processes, otherwise considered to be 'Safety Protocols', are mechanisms that are designed to consider and support various requirements that otherwise exist within our natural world. These systems describe the inter-personal relationships that exist between living entities and in-particular therein - between members of our human family, as does relate to societal systems and related expectations, precautions, requirements and other safety measures. \n\n### Software Languages\n\nThere are several different software languages that are usefully employed when defining AI systems.  There is not any one software language that is considered 'best equipped' to do it all.   AI systems are expected to develop to produce improvements overtime. \n\n#### Business Systems\n\nIt is essential to consider the implications of various business systems that are applied to the use of technology; which has various impactful repercussive effects upon the 'fit for purpose' usefulness of how those technologies have been produced and in-turn applied.  \n\n### Introductory Summary\n\nAI is today, mostly operating as 'CloudAI' systems.  The most well-known variants are operating globally.  What does not exist today, is HumanCentricAI & related SocioSphereAI requirements to support HumanCentricAI.   Whilst there are alot of building-blocks that require implementation in a particular and therefore specified manner; one of the issues that is considered difficult to address, is that the complexity of the models required to support high-quality AI inferencing solutions, are presently very large.  The consequence of this is that they're only able to operate on systems that have much more resources available than is reasonably considered available for 'home users' or in other words, natural persons in their private capacity; or in other words, means to support Human Centric AI. \n\nThe implication of Human Centric AI; does not replace other forms of AI systems; rather, the intended purpose is to provide grounding for the development of societal systems that will in-turn grow to become dependant upon the use of AI in a way that is akin to electricity. \n\nAs such; the complex problem that this note is seeking to illustrate, is about the methods through which it MAY be possible, to develop a solution that supports the ability for users to stream AI 'models' or 'packages' to systems that they control; and are privately employable for the user.  In-turn also, how these systems may in-turn also support, the ability to share and operate on a permissive basis, throughout and between communities; based upon attributes and other discriminating factors.  Noting, this is intended to be about empowerment, rather than harms or discrimination, etc; but therein, the rules about why and how these sorts of functions are achieved, become instrumental to the development of systems that are equipped to achieve any sort of materially protective & positive set of goals.\n\n## Design Challenges & Considerations\n\nAs noted at the start of this document; there's a challenge about how to form useful software that doesn't require an individual to be 'wired into' the broader global 'cloud' 'hive-mind'. \n\n### Notes about Requirements\n\nThere are several 'langauge models' that exist; and have been produced in various formats.  There are differences between the models that exist, and the ability to produce a 'model' (dislike that term, but anyhow) that better takes into consideration various complexities, that are linked with spatio-temporal, sociology factors that often thereafter invokes factors that relate to other languages; whether written or pictorial, results in a complex series of inputs.\n\nFurthermore; as it is said, 'history is told by the winner', which is a material factor that has various implications; that may profoundly determine, that the popular belief about the provonance or meaning of a concept, may not be the accurate objective description of it, but rather a common-place subjective opinion, or objective association of the use of a word or phrase in a particular social spatio-temporal context.  \n\nAn Personal AI agent; should ideally be equipped to support the means to inform the human user of circumstances where the use of particular language in a particular way, may have unintended consequences due to differences between persons and/or groups, in association to the use of any such language.  \n\nThen the extension that is built upon defining an appropriate language AI process (sense) for Human Centric AI (ie: Webizen); thereafter, has an impact on how it is in-turn used by anything that is built on-top of it; and/or, in a manner that makes use of it as a dependency.\n\nIn seeking to figure out how to form a model that supports both the independent and personal and thereafter - use with communities, i've started writing this note... \n\nIt is going to be important to also consider how to support maintainence of the tooling, alongside hygiene and various other factors. \n\n### Compression\n\nThe use of techniques to reduce the size of the files and programs is central to the methods considerations.  These considerations are broader than simply transport related compression methodologies.  The coding schema should consider how techniques that have the effect of reducing the code-base might be effectively applied.  If the code-base is able to assume a degree of existing or predicate information exists within the database, this may be in-turn employed in a manner that reduces both the filesizes and the amount of memory that's used; but, the implications with respect to the processing costs, are something to be considered.\n\nThere's a question about whether and how unique identifiers might be created which have the result of significantly reducing the size of queries otherwise associated with the texts.\n\nQuestion becomes; whether and how look-up tables might be used; and/or how they may already be in use via underlying software.\n\nCompression doesn't matter so much if the model is relatively small and used rarely; however, when the opposite is the case, there's an array of important benefits.\n\n### Decentralised Cryptography Considerations\n\nThere's an array of factors that would benefit from ensuring the methods take into account the idea that there are decentralised and federated schemas in use; in addition to version control related considerations.  The version control issues, end-up being part of the temporal solutions, as changes must occur overtime; rather than simultaniously. \n\nYet, when there is an assumption that a record is the same as is intended; then, there should be some way of verifying / validating that the assumption is correct.\n\nAnother issue that is quite important; is to ensure that there are strong cryptographically enhances measures to control the use of the Networked AI components by human agents.\n\nThis will in-turn require an array of 'safety protocols' that seek to expressly state what the intended characteristics are and what conditions may present an alarm and/or stop process.\n\n### Theory linked considerations.\n\nWorkflow concepts.\n\nUser has basic app installed. \nApp has a database capability. \nApp has a capacity to run models somehow.\nmodels are defined as components. \n\nModels evolve overtime using 'spare' computational capacity.\n\nApp has command set for pulling resources from the web in parts from nodes across the network.  \n\nLinked Considerations: \n\nSETI - the Seti App distributed processing across various nodes.  \n\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/VocabularyModelling/LanguageModels/Alphabets/","title":"Alphabets"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"This folder contains a list of Alphabets, which are kinda essential for developing language models...\n\n### Alphabet Model\n\nTheory is; build an alphabet program / model.

Holborn is a district of London, located in the City of London. The name \"Holborn\" is believed to have originated from the Old English words \"hol\" meaning \"hollow\" and \"burna\" meaning \"stream\", together meaning \"hollow stream\". However, it is not related to Old Norse, it is a name that comes from Old English, which is a Germanic language like Old Norse.\n\n***My Question: The wikipedia article about holborn head https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holborn_Head says: The name Holborn appears Norse in origin, meaning hillfort.***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nYou are correct, my apologies for the confusion. The name \"Holborn\" does have a meaning in Old Norse, and it does come from Norse origin. Holborn Head is believed to be derived from the Old Norse word \"hol\" meaning \"hill\" and \"burna\" meaning \"stream\" which would make \"Holborn\" meaning \"hill stream\" or \"hill fort\" as you mentioned. I apologize for any confusion my previous response may have caused.\n\n***My Question: how does burna mean fort? please describe...***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nI apologize for the confusion, \"burna\" does not mean \"fort\" in Old Norse. Burna is a noun meaning \"stream\" or \"brook\", it is not related to the meaning of fort. The Old Norse word for fort is \"borg\" or \"bur\"\n\nThe name \"Holborn\" is believed to have been derived from the Old English words \"hol\" meaning \"hollow\" and \"burna\" meaning \"stream\" which would make \"Holborn\" meaning \"hollow stream\" and not \"hill fort\". The origin of the name Holborn is still debated, and the association with Old Norse language is not clear, it could be a coincidence that the name sounds Norse.\n\nwhat is the basis of the argument that supports the theory that holborn is derived from hol (meaning hill) and born (meaning fort) in relation to the norse language?\n\nThe argument that Holborn is derived from the Old Norse words \"hol\" meaning \"hill\" and \"born\" meaning \"fort\" is based on the etymology of the name Holborn. The origin of the name Holborn is still debated, and there is no clear evidence that supports the theory that it's derived from Old Norse words. The association with Old Norse language is speculative and it could be a coincidence that the name sounds Norse.\n\nIt's important to note that etymology is a complex subject and the origin of a word or name is not always easy to trace. The meaning and origin of words and names can change over time, and different theories may be proposed for a single word.\n\nIt is worth to mention that, Old English and Old Norse are closely related languages, both are Germanic languages, which means that many words and names from Old English have similar sound and meaning to words in Old Norse, this could be the reason why some people associate Holborn with Old Norse.\n\n***My Question: what language did the people who lived nearby holborn head in the Highland area of Scotland speak during the first century AD?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nIt is difficult to say for certain what language the people who lived near Holborn Head in the Highland area of Scotland spoke during the 1st century AD, as there is limited historical documentation from that time period. However, it is believed that the ancient Celtic people known as the Picts, who lived in the area that is now Scotland, spoke a Celtic language. The language spoken by the Picts is referred to as \"Picts' language\" but it is not known exactly what it was.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the area of Scotland known as the Highlands was not heavily settled in the 1st century AD and it was considered as a remote and wild area. The Highland area was not heavily populated until the later centuries.\n\nIt's also important to note that the area of Holborn Head is located in the lowland area of Scotland, and not in the highland area. Holborn Head is a location in the Scottish Borders, which is in the south-east of Scotland and not in the Highland area.\n\n***My Question: was the area ever populated by persons who spoke norse or old norse? if so, during what time historically?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nThe area of Scotland, including the Holborn Head location, was settled by Norse and Old Norse speaking Vikings during the Viking Age. The Vikings began raiding the Scottish coast in the late 8th century and by the 9th century, they had established settlements in several coastal areas of Scotland, including the Scottish islands, Shetland, Orkney, Hebrides, and the Northern and Western coasts.\n\nThese settlements became known as the \"Norse-Gaelic\" communities and the people spoke a variant of Old Norse known as Norn which was heavily influenced by the native Celtic languages. These settlements existed for several centuries, with the Viking presence in the islands lasting the longest, until the 15th century.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Vikings didn't settle in the inland of Scotland, the Holborn Head location is in the lowland area of Scotland, and not in the coastal area where the Norse settlements were established.\n\n***My Question: if it is not located in the coastal area, why is there a Holburn Head Lighthouse?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nHolburn Head Lighthouse is located near the village of Gairloch in the Highland region of Scotland, and it's not situated in the lowland area as I mentioned before. My apologies for the confusion.\n\nLighthouses are built to guide ships and boats safely through a coastal area and it is not strange that a lighthouse was built at Holburn Head location despite it being not a coastal area as such, this is because the lighthouse is built on a headland which is a promontory of land that extends out from a coast into a body of water and the lighthouse guides ships through the area of the Minch, a strait that separates the mainland of Scotland from the Outer Hebrides. The lighthouse was built in 1849, the area was used for fishing, and there was a risk of ships running aground on the rocky headland, the lighthouse was built to help ships navigate safely in the area.\n\n***My Question: ok. so, your earlier statements about holborn or holburn in relation to the location of Holborn Head were incorrect. So, was the area surrounding the was the area of Holburn Head Lighthouse and nearby places ever populated by persons who spoke norse or old norse? if so, during what time historically?***\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier statements. The area surrounding the Holburn Head Lighthouse, including the village of Gairloch, was not settled by Norse or Old Norse speakers during the Viking Age. The area is located in the Scottish Highlands, which was not heavily settled during the Viking Age. The Vikings primarily settled in coastal areas, such as the Scottish islands and the Northern and Western coasts, and did not establish settlements in the inland areas, like the Scottish Highlands. The Holburn Head Lighthouse is in the highland area, and it is not likely that the area was settled by people who spoke Norse or Old Norse.\n\n***My Question: What sources are you basing your generated opinions on?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nAs a machine learning model, I use the information I've been trained on to generate responses to questions. My knowledge cut off date is 2021, so I base my answers on the information that was available up until that time. In the case of Holburn Head Lighthouse and the surrounding area, the information I provided is based on the historical records and studies of the Viking settlements in Scotland, and the historical context of the lighthouse's construction in 1849, as well as the geography of the location. It's important to note that history is a complex field and new findings can come to light that could change our understanding of certain historical events and context.\n\n***My Question: how does the term Gaelic relate to the village of Gairloch?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nThe village of Gairloch is located in the Scottish Highlands, an area that has a long and rich history of Celtic culture and language. The indigenous language of the Scottish Highlands is Scottish Gaelic, which is a Celtic language that is closely related to Irish and Manx Gaelic. It has been spoken in the area for centuries, and it is still spoken by some people today.\n\nGaelic is the traditional language spoken by the people of Gairloch, and it was the main language spoken in the area until the 19th century when the population of the village and the area decreased and the use of the language also decreased. Today, Gaelic is not widely spoken in Gairloch and the surrounding areas, but it is still used by a small number of people, and it is taught in schools and there are efforts to preserve the language and its culture.\n\n***My Question: Why does the concept of Norse-Gaelic exist, if there were no people who spoke norse in gairloch?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nI apologize for any confusion, Norse-Gaelic is a term used to describe the culture and language of the Viking settlements in Scotland and the Western Isles, not a specific location such as Gairloch. The term refers to the fusion of Norse and Gaelic cultures that occurred in the areas where the Vikings established settlements, primarily in the Scottish islands and the Northern and Western coasts.\n\nThe Vikings who settled in these areas, known as the \"Norse-Gaelic\" communities, spoke a variant of Old Norse called Norn which was heavily influenced by the native Celtic languages such as Scottish Gaelic. This fusion of languages, culture, and customs created a unique blend of Norse and Gaelic elements that is known as \"Norse-Gaelic\".\n\nGairloch is located in the Scottish Highlands, it is not a coastal area and it was not settled by the Norse during the Viking age, so the term Norse-Gaelic does not apply to Gairloch. I apologize if my previous answers have caused confusion on this matter.\n\n***My Question: Holborn Head is at 58°37′23″N 03°32′06″W. what language was spoken in that area during the Viking Age***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nHolborn Head is located in Scotland and during the Viking Age, which is generally considered to be from the late 8th century to the 11th century, the area would have been inhabited by the native Picts, who spoke a Celtic language, and not by the Vikings who spoke Old Norse. The Vikings primarily targeted the coastal areas of Scotland for settlement and raid, and did not establish settlements in the inland areas like the area of Holborn Head. The Vikings mainly sought to raid and plunder the coastal monasteries and settlements, and not to settle in the area. I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous responses, and for any errors in my geography.\n\n***My Question: Did the vikings establish hill-forts?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nDuring the Viking Age, it is not commonly known for the Vikings to have built hill forts, as this was not their traditional way of fortifying their settlements. The Vikings were primarily sea-faring raiders and traders, and their settlements were typically coastal or riverine in nature.\n\nVikings settlements were usually fortified by stockade, ditches or palisades and in some cases by the building of earthworks. They did not build the kind of fortified settlements that were common in other cultures of the time, such as the hill forts built by the Celts.\n\nIt's important to note that the Viking Age is a historical period and more research could change our understanding of the facts, but for now, it is not known that the Vikings built hill forts.\n\n***My Question: What cultures built hill forts during that time?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nDuring the Viking Age, which is generally considered to be from the late 8th century to the 11th century, several cultures built hill forts as a way of fortifying their settlements.\n\nThe Celts, who inhabited many parts of Europe, including Britain and Ireland, built hill forts as a means of defending their settlements. These forts were typically built on high ground, and often featured multiple layers of walls and ditches for defense.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons, who settled in England after the departure of the Roman Empire, also built hill forts. These forts were known as burhs and were typically located on high ground and were used as defensive settlements and centers of administration.\n\nIn addition, the Slavs and the Germanic tribes also built hill forts during the Viking Age as a way to protect their settlements and communities.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the Vikings also built fortified settlements, but these were typically coastal or riverine in nature, and not hill forts.\n\n***My Question: what sort of fortified settlement did vikings create in coastal areas?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nDuring the Viking Age, the Vikings established settlements in several coastal areas, such as the Scottish islands, Shetland, Orkney, Hebrides, and the Northern and Western coasts of Scotland and Ireland. These settlements were typically fortified by stockades, ditches or palisades, and in some cases, by the building of earthworks.\n\nOne of the most common types of fortification used by the Vikings was the longhouse. These were large wooden buildings that could be used for both living and storage, and they often had a wall or palisade built around them for defense. The longhouses were typically built on the coast and near rivers, as they needed to be easily accessible by ship.\n\nAnother type of fortification used by the Vikings was the ringfort, also known as a rath or broch. These were circular earthworks that were used to enclose and protect a settlement. They typically had a ditch around the perimeter and a wooden palisade on top of the earthwork.\n\nIn addition, the Vikings also built fortresses, these were typically built on strategic locations such as the mouth of a river or on a headland, it was designed to protect the area from invaders, and to control the trade routes.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the Vikings, as raiders, also plundered and attacked many coastal settlements, monasteries, and towns and didn't always built fortified settlements.\n\n***My Question: Did the Celts travel to londinium? if so, where did they stay?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nDuring the Roman period, the Celts, who inhabited many parts of Europe, including Britain, did travel to Londinium (modern-day London), which was a Roman city and an important center of trade and commerce. However, it is not clear where the Celts stayed when they visited Londinium.\n\nIt is known that Londinium had a diverse population, including both Roman citizens and foreigners, and it is likely that the Celts would have been among the foreigners who visited the city. However, there is little direct evidence of where they may have stayed. It's possible that they could have stayed in temporary accommodation such as inns or taverns, or they may have stayed with relatives or friends who lived in the city.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the Celts were not one homogeneous group, there were different tribes with their own culture and customs, and the Celts that were in Londinium would have been from different tribes, and their behavior and living arrangements would have varied.\n\n***My Question: Did the vikings and/or persons who spoke norse travel to londinium? if so, where did they stay?***\n\n**ChatGPT:** \nDuring the Viking Age, which is generally considered to be from the late 8th century to the 11th century, the Vikings, who spoke Old Norse, did travel to Londinium (modern-day London), as part of their raiding and trading activities. However, it is not clear where the Vikings would have stayed when they visited Londinium.\n\nIt is known that the Vikings, as raiders, attacked Londinium and other towns and monasteries along the Thames in 842 AD, and again in 851 AD, and likely other times as well. It is likely that when they came to Londinium, they stayed in temporary accommodation such as inns or taverns, or they may have stayed with relatives or friends who lived in the city.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the Vikings were not one homogeneous group, they came from different places and different tribes, and their behavior and living arrangements would have varied. Also, the Vikings were primarily interested in looting and plundering, and not in establishing settlements in Londinium or other Roman cities.\n\n***My Question: what is the earliest known time the english language was first used?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nThe earliest known use of the English language dates back to the 5th century AD, when Germanic tribes, such as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, began to migrate to the island of Great Britain and settled there. These tribes spoke a Germanic language, which over time evolved into Old English.\n\nOld English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was the language spoken in England from the 5th century to the Norman conquest in 1066 AD. Old English is considered to be the earliest form of the English language, and it was written in the runic alphabet, which was later replaced by the Latin alphabet.\n\nOld English was a complex and inflected language, with a rich vocabulary and many grammatical features. However, it was quite different from the English spoken today and would be difficult for modern speakers to understand without study or translation.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes were not the only people that were in Great Britain during this time, there were also the Celts, and others, and they were speaking different languages, and the Germanic language of the invaders slowly replaced the Celtic languages and others, it took several centuries to form the language we know today as English.\n\n***My Question: Where were the Normans From?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nThe Normans were originally from the region now known as Norway, Denmark, and northern France. They were Vikings who had settled in the area now known as the region of Normandy in northern France. The Normans adopted the French language and culture and became known as the Normans.\n\nIn the 11th century, under the leadership of William, Duke of Normandy, they conquered England in 1066 in the Battle of Hastings. The Norman conquest of England was a significant event in the history of the English language, as it brought many French words and phrases into the English language. This event marked the beginning of a new era, the Middle English.\n\nThe Normans also went on to conquer other parts of Europe, such as Southern Italy, Sicily, and parts of the Middle East. They also established a powerful Norman kingdom in England, which became known for its skilled soldiers, powerful nobles, and great castles.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the Normans were not only Vikings, the term \"Norman\" referred to the people from the region of Normandy, which was a melting pot of different cultures and people, and the Normans were a diverse group of people, with different origins.\n\n***My Question: what was the history of the Holborn computer and why was it called holborn? ***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nI am not aware of any specific computer called Holborn, as far as I know, there isn't any information about any computer or electronic device with that name. The name Holborn is most commonly associated with the area in London, England, which is mentioned in many historical records, but not with a computer.\n\nIt is possible that you might have misspelled the name, or the computer you are referring to is a lesser-known device that I do not have information about. Can you please provide more details or context about the Holborn computer you are referring to?\n\n***My Question: here is a wikipedia link that describes the holborn computer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holborn_9100***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nI apologize for the confusion. Upon checking the Wikipedia link you provided, it appears that the Holborn 9100 was a computer system that was developed and manufactured by the Holborn Computer Corporation in the 1970s. The Holborn 9100 was a mainframe computer that used a unique architecture and was designed to provide high performance at a lower cost than other mainframe computers of the time. The system was based on the IBM System/360 architecture, but it featured a number of innovations such as a new memory management system, and a new input/output architecture.\n\nIt is not clear from the Wikipedia article why the computer was called Holborn 9100, it could have been based on the name of the company or the location of the company. It's worth mentioning that the Holborn 9100 was not a well-known computer, and the company Holborn Computer Corporation was not a major player in the computer industry, and not much information about this computer is available today.\n\n\n***My Question: why was it called holborn?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nThe reason for the computer being called Holborn is not mentioned in the Wikipedia article you provided, and I could not find any other reliable source that explains the origin of the name. It is possible that the computer was named after the Holborn Computer Corporation, which developed and manufactured the system, or it could have been named after the location of the company, If the company was based in the area of Holborn in London. However, this is just speculation, as I was unable to find any concrete information about the origin of the name.\n\n\n***My Question:  Were people always allowed into the londinium or did they need to ask permission before entering the gates. If some needed to ask permission, ie: soldiers, and they traveled from the south, did they go via holborn? did they seek permission to enter londinium in holborn?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nLondinium was a Roman city established around AD 43, during the Roman conquest of Britain. As a Roman city, Londinium would have had a set of gates that controlled access to the city. It's likely that these gates were guarded by Roman soldiers, and that access to the city was restricted to those who were authorized to enter.\n\nPeople traveling from the south would have had to cross the River Thames to reach Londinium, and it's likely that they would have had to pass through the gates to gain entry to the city. It's not clear if there was a specific location where travelers would have had to ask permission to enter the city, such as a guard station or checkpoint near the gates.\n\nAs for Holborn, it is not clear if it was a significant location during the Roman period, it is not mentioned in any historical records from that time. There is no evidence that people needed to ask permission to enter Londinium in Holborn, or that people would have passed through Holborn on their way to Londinium. The Roman city of Londinium was located in the present-day City of London, and Holborn is located in the London Borough of Camden, which is north of the River Thames.\n\n***My Question: Where was the original templar temple located? was it in holborn?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nThe original location of the Temple of the Knights Templar in London, England was on the site where the present Temple Church stands today, it is located in the City of London, between Fleet Street and the River Thames, it is not located in Holborn.\n\nThe Knights Templar was a medieval Christian military order founded in the 12th century, the order was founded in the aftermath of the First Crusade and it's original purpose was to protect Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. The order established its headquarters in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and had a number of properties in the Holy Land and Europe, one of them was in London, where the order built a church, which was consecrated in 1185.\n\nIt's worth noting that Holborn, as a location, did not exist during the time of the Knights Templar, it was a rural area outside the city walls of London, it wasn't until centuries later that it became an urban district.\n\n\n***My Question: Do you undestand heraldry? what do the symbols on the Holborn Crest mean?***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nHeraldry is the practice of devising, granting, displaying, describing, and recording coats of arms and heraldic badges, as well as of tracing and recording genealogies. The Holborn Crest you are referring to is likely the coat of arms of Holborn, which is a district in London, England.\n\nA coat of arms typically consists of several different elements, including a shield, a crest, a helmet, a mantling, and various other items such as supporters and motto. Each of these elements has its own meaning and symbolism, and the composition of the coat of arms is intended to convey the history and identity of the person or organization it represents.\n\nI'm sorry but I don't have information about a Holborn Crest, in order to understand what the symbols on the crest mean it's important to have the design and the historical context of the crest. If the crest is not well-known, it may not have been recorded by historical sources, or it could have been created recently and not have an official status.\n\n\n***My Question: Here is some information: Official blazon Arms: Argent a Cross Gules charged in the centre point with a Hind pierced by an Arrow Or and on a Chief Sable three Escallops of the field. Crest: Out of a Mural Crown proper a demi Figure representing St. Andrew the Apostle vested Azure holding in the dexter hand an open Boook also proper and supporting on his sinister arm a Saltire Azure. Supporters: On the dexter a Lion and in the sinister a Gryphon both Or each gorged with a Collar Gules suspended therefrom an Escutcheon barry wavy of ten Argent and Azure. Motto: 'MULTI PERTRANSIBUNT ET AUGEBITUR SCIENTIA'-Many shall pass through and learning shall be increased***\n\n**ChatGPT:**\nThe blazon you provided describes the elements of the coat of arms of Holborn, which is a district in London, England.\n\nThe shield on the coat of arms is divided into three sections. The top section, or chief, is colored black and features three silver escallops, which are a type of seashell often used as a heraldic charge. The center of the shield features a red cross, which is a common symbol of Christianity, and in this case, it is charged with a gold hind (a female deer) that is pierced by a gold arrow.

The implied implications relates to the formation of tools to support the development of personal ontology, an API that relates to how people 'sense' one another both at the time, and as a consequence of reviewing historical records.  \n\nAs such, it is not one model; but it is indeed software, so the term that will be used in relation to the development of software that in-turn produces language related software components, which may be called models - will simply be called 'sense'...  'sense' is thought likely to evolve into something that becomes best implemented as a form of Neuromophic software application. \n\nThe end goals is to form a comprehensive model of the English language and its various dialects and industry specific vocabularies.  \n\nThis will be achieved by forming a generative model that is able to be improved upon overtime through human-assisted training.  The model will be able to be used in a variety of contexts, including but not limited to:\n\n    * Dictionary and Spellcheck\n    * Ontology Production\n    * Ontology Reasoning\n    * Search indexing\n    * Recommendation Engine\n    * Search\n    * Database Queries\n    * Database Structures\n    * Content Metadata Generation\n    * Ai Assistants\n    * API Generation\n  \n## Program Construct\n\nThe program produced should operate in a decentralised manner across IPv6 connected devices.  The systems will require authentication and a variety of other considerations to be properly met.  The early versions are likely to be less secure than future generations. \n\nIt is intended that other application will make use of the sense system, as a required library.\n\n\n### Notes about Existing Language Model\n\nThis note provides some resources that are either duplicates or an extention of the [PCTWebizenUseOfOntology] notes made also. \n\nIn the webizen ecosystem; one of the objectives is to seek to create top-level ontology that is sought to be fit-for-purpose for applications relating to human beings (self); then sociosphere / sociology and biosphere ontologies.  in combination this may be considered an approach that seeks to distinguish our consciousness and our natural world; as something other than another persons 'thing'.  Then, whilst there are many ontologies to describe things, new ontologies may be created using natural language; which would in-turn also be defined in a way that creates meaningful relationships between existing ontologies and [[PCTOntologyModelling]] outputs.\n\nThere are some existing Vocab Models that are defined using RDF/OWL.\n\nAny that are not listed below will be be added to [this NLP google-drive repo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GVo9jTHBNk597u-jmmT9TFPbaNaSEhi4) that also stores info about NLP related docs and notes (although there may be more elsewhere)\n\n### Pre:Existing Large Language Models.\n\nWhilst investigating solutions, an array of existing language models have been identified that provide a great deal of the underlying data that is considered to be required, although the methods to employ best employ them is presently unclear. \n\nWhilst making a note of the work done previously making enquiries with ChatGPT as is illustrated by: [ChatGPTDynamicOntology] and in-turn the [[VocabularyModelling]] folder has been created to 'create space' for more thougher investigation. In-order to illustrate the considerations; i'll start with illustrating the resources that i've found so far. \n\n## NLP Notes\n\nAs is more broadly considered to be a generalisation, the ecosystems are designed to support Natural Language Processing as a foundational AI capability. \n\n***This note is undeveloped and is now therefore on the 'todo list', although, the location of this document may change as the NLP functions are more related to the webizen agent than the PCT systems that need to be designed to support it.***\n\nTBD - \n\n### Natural Language Processing vs. ChatGPT\n\nAs a consequence of the public release of ChatGPT - large-scale 'natural language' models are perhaps the most significant area of discussion generally - in relation to the use of AI, at the moment.  Consequentially also, it seems to me as though there's also some level of confusion about the nature of natural language processing generally and what it is that i'm working to achieve.  The implicit implication is that these large language models are far too big and hardware intensive to run on any one machine.  \n\nAlso, they're not simply a model that is about 'english' as a language, rather, services like ChatGPT have a comprehensive knowledge (database) that it has harvested from the internet, that embody the contributions of many billions of persons over time. Perhaps, a better term for it might be that it is a 'knowledge platform' rather than more simply being a 'natural language model'.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum; are dictionary files that have been part of word-processing software for decades and indeed also - there are various examples of electronic dictionary devices that are very much like caculators; therein, the amount of hardware/software resources required to make basic dictionaries work - must be minor.\n\n***Asking ChatGPT to provide some information (given public sources couldn't otherwise be easily identified); ChatGPT provided the following information,***\n\n*Electronic software dictionaries have a long history dating back to the 1970s. One of the earliest examples of an electronic dictionary was the FED-2, created by the Soviet company \"FED\" in 1971. It was a translation device that used punch cards and a built-in CRT screen.*\n\n*In the 1980s and 1990s, electronic dictionaries started to become more advanced and portable, with the introduction of devices such as the Franklin Electronic Publishers' \"Bookman\" and the Casio \"Data Plus\" series, which could fit into a pocket and could be powered by batteries. These early electronic dictionaries were limited in their storage capacity and typically held a small fraction of the words found in print dictionaries.*\n\n*In the late 1990s, the first electronic dictionaries with built-in TFT screens and more advanced search functions were developed, such as the Seiko ER6700, which had a 2-megabyte memory and could store around 30,000 words.*\n\nAs such; there is a spectrum between what is easily achieved, what may be feasibly achieved and in-turn what cannot be achieved at this time; without the use of public APIs.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/VocabularyModelling/LanguageModels/Mathematics/","title":"Mathematics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"## Mathematics Ontology\n\nThe use of these works, whilst sought to be designed to support Human Centric principals (including Human Centric AI principals); will end-up being processed by a software agent (on a computer).

Whilst an interface to support the means to exchange information between webizen and non-webizen systems is required; there is an opportunity, that is brought about by the work on Permissive Commons, to redefine how these ecosystems work.\n\nIt is thought that the opportunity to address any fundamental issues are not necessarily going to exist forever - if the ecosystem is succesfully deployed and taken-up by many. \n\nIn the Webizen ecosystem, most systems are managed using Ontology.  As such, the ontological structures are an essential foundational component that is required to build anything useful with - ontologies.\n\nWhen considering how to define (implementation) these new ontological structures; an array of study was undertaken to consider how the use of vocabulary may be best used to do so. \n\n\nThe purpose of this note, is intended to be about work to define 'something that works' even though, the methods employed to do so - are not intended to be a comprehensive illustration of the broader approach that is sought to be considered, and equipped to be undertaken.  \n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/VocabularyModelling/LanguageModels/WordsAPI/","title":"WordsAPI"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nAn API for the English Language.\n\nhttps://www.wordsapi.com/\n\nFind definitions, related words, and more, with a simple to use RESTful API\n- Words API is Dictionary: Use it to find definitions for more than 150,000 words. \n- A Thesaurus: You can find synonyms, antonyms, or similar words. \n\nWords API includes hierarchical information, such as knowing that:\n-   a [hatchback](https://www.wordsapi.com/#try) is a **type of** [car](https://www.wordsapi.com/#try)\n-   a [finger](https://www.wordsapi.com/#try) is a **part of** a [hand](https://www.wordsapi.com/#try)\n-   [oxygen](https://www.wordsapi.com/#try) is a **substance of** [water](https://www.wordsapi.com/#try)\n\nNOTES: its a JSON api.

It is shaped by the cultural and social context in which it is developed, and it reflects the values, beliefs, and assumptions of the people who create it.\n\nIn sociology, the concept of ontology is often used to refer to the way that individuals and groups make sense of the world and their place within it. This includes their understanding of the nature of reality, the categories and concepts that they use to make sense of the world, and the relationships between these concepts.\n\nIn social interactions, individuals and groups often have different ontologies, reflecting their different experiences and perspectives. These differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, as people may use different terms and categories to describe the same thing, or may have different assumptions about the nature of reality.\n\nHowever, ontologies can also be shared and negotiated through social interactions, as individuals and groups engage in dialogue and communication. Through these interactions, people can come to a shared understanding of the world and the concepts that exist within it, allowing them to communicate more effectively and collaborate more effectively.\n\nOne of the best examples i know of was done by [Jason Silva: Shots of Awe](https://www.youtube.com/@ShotsOfAwe) \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nA discussion about the concept\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HTw3jocJBrw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n## What is Ontology Modelling?\n\nOntology modeling is the process of creating a structured representation of a domain of knowledge. An ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to define the vocabulary of a domain, as well as the types of relationships that can exist between concepts.\n\nOntologies are typically created using a formal language, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). They can be used to represent a wide range of knowledge, including scientific, medical, and even business knowledge.\n\nThere are several benefits to using ontologies in modeling a domain of knowledge. They allow for the creation of a common vocabulary that can be shared by multiple users or systems. They also enable the creation of more precise and unambiguous definitions of concepts, which can improve communication and understanding within a domain. Finally, ontologies can be used to enable automated reasoning, allowing computers to make inferences and draw conclusions based on the knowledge represented in the ontology.\n\n\nOntology employs vocabulary and is innately and somewhat inextricably linked with the mechanisms considered instrumental to consciousness; through which we organise  communications of thought and embedded concepts.  These systems lead to an implicit design of embedded ideology, values and belief systems; whether or not it is intended.  \n\n#### Semantic Web Historical Notes\n\n**Semantic Web**, extension of the [World Wide Web](https://www.britannica.com/topic/World-Wide-Web) (WWW) in which data are given meaning ([semantics](https://www.britannica.com/science/semantics)) to enable [computers](https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer) to look up and “reason” in response to user searches. One of the strongest proponents of the Semantic Web is [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tim-Berners-Lee), the British inventor of the WWW and the director of the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.britannica.com/topic/World-Wide-Web-Consortium) (W3C), which oversees standards for the project.\n\nBerners-Lee had [envisioned](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/envisioned) the Semantic Web by at least 1994, only a few years after he began developing the WWW in 1989. He unveiled his idea for the Semantic Web at the First International WWW Conference, held in 1994, which resulted in the formation of the W3C.\n\nSource:  [britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Semantic-Web) \n\nPart of the history of this project is that it appears to have been initially supported via the DARPA related project that created [DAML](https://web.archive.org/web/20030207042906/http://www.daml.org/about.html) +[OIL](https://tomhalljones.com/web/ontology-inference-layer-oil/).  which then led to [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) that provides a top-level concept of `owl:thing`, although [[FOAF]]  (which was originally created prior to OWL) does not define a person as a a subclass of `owl:thing` although other examples of FOAF appear to have changed the semantics to include it.  This may be due to 'tool lock-ins', where some tools are designed to be specifically designed to use / work with OWL.  \n\nSome of these sorts of issues are difficult and confusing to both figure out and thereby form a comprehension about the intended designs / purpose; as the semantics matter, yet the ability to ensure comprehensible meanings - is seemingly challenged in some way; perhaps its just me, or perhaps its a broader problem, idk.  \n\nNOTE:  A great deal of these works are very much centred upon forming an information fabric that renders an environment through which Human Beings employ Tools (ie: ICT) in a manner that defines Human Beings as the primary (yet indirect) agents; not as a 'thing' but rather as 'beings'.  Whilst it appears as though these sorts of sentiments were seemingly expressed in the original [[FOAF]] works, the confusion (whether its due to my own confusion or other exteral issues or perhaps both) as to whether the predicate is `owl:thing` (whereby a person is a sub-class of thing) or whether human beings are independently represented, is not as clearly defined as is otherwise sought to be addressed.  \n\nTherein - the FOAF project was created sometime between the late 1990's and before 2001 (the history is sometimes hard to find).\n\nThe sitaution / growth of the internet at that stage; was at a very different level, as were the circumstances related to what usecases might be reasonably defined for systems of that time.\n\nSo, whilst the work done back then was indeed remarkable - and seemingly done in a manner that was mindful of - at least - the basic needs of human beings; perhaps there's validity in seeking to reinvent the modelling to uplift how future systems are made to work.\n\n#### Considerations\n\nThe High level concepts that are being considered;\n\nPresently, the primary ontological predicate is mostly `owl:thing` which thereby defines everything described by it a subclass of `thing`. Whilst this makes sense for `things`, i do not like the concept of human beings defined as a subclass of `thing` nor is it necessarily appropriate to define other parts of life as `things`; so perhaps this can be seperated as to form the logical foundations for seperating the human kind,  the thing created by humankind and things (see - not sure what other term?) of our world, particularly therein - life.\n\nThereafter; one consitituency of the considerations is how to seperate the Conceptual 'spheres'\n\nThe ontological considerations relating to humans should also support considerations about qualia and 'philosophy of mind' related considerations; whereas the [Biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere) related factors may be subject to some sort of property rights / law related assertions; but they do not exist because of mankind; rather, they are constituencies of what may be referred to as our natural world or what many would consider to be things or parts of 'god', including but not limited to - life.  This in-turn has an array of implications relating to the differences between inventions (of man) and discoveries (of / for mankind). As an extension of these considerations the term [Infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)  is thereby linked to the term [inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) which i've previously used extensively when seeking to forge appropriate namonclature to describe the informational representation of a human being, and implicitly therein - consciousness; in a manner that is not improperly disruptive to [[FreedomofThought]].  As a consequence of previous works, i am convinced that there is a meaningful relationship between the field of study and communications of concepts broadly defined as quantum physics. Herein, as the ramifications are difficult to easily provide a mechanism for people to generally test and observe themselves; the implication of how to form meaningful insights or considerations; in so far as i have found, moreover relates to the way in which these concepts relating to physics and natural systems, are described.\n\nOne such example that is short, and therefore more useful than the longer presentations and/or lectures on the topic; is the short description provided by Henry Strapp on Quantum Mechanics and Human Consciousness; in it, strapp describes the importance of the role of the observer (the conscious agent).\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYPjXz1MVv0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nHTTP(s) based ontologies are fundamental to the Semantic Web; which has later been termed 'linked data'.  \n\nIn a w3c post; it describes linked data in the following way,\n\nTim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web and initiator of the Linked Data project, suggested a 5 star deployment scheme for Linked Data.

In-effect, as is one of the many topics of [[TheValuesProject]] the ability for people to have their fundamental human rights supported in a way that supports principals such as privacy and moreover the requirements people have in-order to support human dignity.  This requires a means to decentralise the publically consumable knowledge of mankind in such a way that provides us, members of our human family as beneficiaries of these bodies of knowledge; to in-effect, be furnished a means to make use of that information using modern societal tools in a way that does not require us to submit to unwanted abuses of human rights. \n\n#### The SocioEconomic Factors\n\nThe way 'commons' information has been developed for use on internet is now highly centralised, not simply at the level of which websites but moreover which jurisitictions; leading to a circumstance where our ability to define reality is highly dependant upon the few persons involved in making laws in one place on earth which have repercussive effects globally.  This is a well known characteristic for many who are significantly involved.\n\nMany of these websites continue to present requests for financial donations to be provided to support their services; and whilst it is absolutely the case that these services are essential, they have also been designed in a particular way which leads to a significant responsibility. \n\nThese systems of donations do not equally consider how the human labour of those involved in creating the materials might also be considered work; and good work, should be paid - but not paid in perpetuiety (ie: not subject to royalties); which in-turn leads to a few mechanisms that manifest, the first is that 'commons' materials become more easily targeted (increasingly on a programmatic basis) by bad actors (humans, organisations, software / AI) to change the records of what humanity depends upon as knowledge, to suit agendas relating to some particular issue that might be happening at any given time.  Given these systems are unlike books; the content can be changed whenever and the ability to see the history is not easy.\n\nOverall; there are a few variables that relate to issues that have manifested as a consequence of the 'commons' now becoming managed by systems that are so globally centralised legally.\n\n### The Technical Factors\n\nIn-order to support [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI]] and [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] commons information needs to be formatted into [[SemanticWeb]] standards related formats, and this should be done in a way where it is clear who defined the content of the resource (ie: a human being, a company or legal entity or a software agent); and then it needs to be able to be processed locally, without providing constant updates to the providers of any such resources that are essential for the use of computing systems in life.  \n\n## Introductory Summary\n\n> Imagine if, we were only able to be entitled to use the English Language if we agreed to use a spell-checker that constantly provided to an `overlord` the information we generate about everything that we were using the english language to perform, as a requirement for using the english language...   \n> \n> This is one of many constituencies to the far broader 'commons' which permissive commons systems seek to ensure, are able to be used locally without providing any one any information about how we're using it at the time when we're using it; whilst then also, providing a means to create AI related functionality for the things that we end-up sharing with others; once we've decided to do so, and only in relation to the use of those works in relation to whomever it is we've decided to share it with.  \n\n\n## External References\n\nBelow are some definitions sourced elsewhere...\n\n#### WikiPedia: Commons\n\nThe **commons** is the [cultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture \"Culture\") and [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature \"Nature\") resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable Earth.

Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism.[cite 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-ReferenceA-1) Commons can also be [defined as a social practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#Commoning_as_a_process \"Commons\")[cite 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-:0-2) of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates.[cite 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-3) \n\n\n### Wikipedia: Digital commons\n\nMain article: [Digital commons (economics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics) \"Digital commons (economics)\")\n\n[Mayo Fuster Morell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Fuster_Morell \"Mayo Fuster Morell\") proposed a definition of digital commons as \"information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be (generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity. Additionally, the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources.\"[cite 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-23)[Cite 24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-24)\n\nExamples of digital commons are [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia \"Wikipedia\"), [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software \"Free software\") and [open-source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware \"Open-source hardware\") projects.\n\nSource: [WikiPedia: Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)\n\nSource: [WikiPedia: Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)\n\n### Wikipedia: Digital commons (economics)\n\nThe **digital commons** are a form of [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons \"Commons\") involving the distribution and communal ownership of [informational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology \"Information technology\") and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology \"Technology\").

Then the other issue is that the structure of the files haven't been defined using RDF [[Ontologies]] so, it is more difficult or more expensive (time/energy) to create software that can make use of this information with other datasets. \n\n[[PermissiveCommons]] uplifts Open-Data towards [[OpenDatav3.0PermissiveCommons]].\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/About/WhatIsWebScience/","title":"What is Web-Science"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# What is Web-Science\n\nThe primary way through which Web Science works are sought to be progressed, is moreover via WebCivics activities, as is distinct to the creation of the specifically branded solutions ecosystem that is intended to support the production of technology for the public good via the [[WebizenAlliance]] and related works that are moreover about the [[PCT-WebizenTechStack]] specifically (ie:  [[Webizen 3.0]], [[Webizen 3.5]], etc), whilst being informed by WebCivics / WebScience works seek to address the broader [[SocialFactors]] and provide practical outcomes that can be made to work via Webizen systems, and others that seek to support the values.\n\n### What is Web Science?\n\n![[webscience.jpeg]]\nSource: A [tweet](https://twitter.com/sotonWSI/status/1172458143428816896) \"Keynote with [@DameWendyDBE](https://twitter.com/DameWendyDBE) ‘Web Science, AI and the Future of the Internet’ at [#WWSSS19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWSSS19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  [@sotonWSI September 13, 2019](https://twitter.com/sotonWSI/status/1172458143428816896)\"\n\nBelow is a definition of 'Web Science' as provided by  [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) .\n\nWeb Science is an interdisciplinary field that studies the social, technical, and economic aspects of the World Wide Web and the internet. It combines elements of computer science, information science, sociology, economics, and other disciplines to understand the complex social, technical, and economic systems that make up the web.\n\nWeb Science researchers study topics such as the structure and evolution of the web, the impact of the web on society and culture, and the ways in which the web can be used to support research, education, and business. They also study the technical and social challenges associated with building and maintaining the web, such as privacy, security, and misinformation.\n\nWeb Science is a relatively new field, and it is still evolving. However, it is an important area of study, as the web and the internet have become increasingly central to many aspects of modern life, and understanding their impact and potential is crucial for both academia and society as a whole.\n\nWeb Science research often involves the use of computational methods and data analysis to study the web and the internet. This can include the use of machine learning algorithms, network analysis techniques, and data visualization tools to understand patterns and trends on the web.\n\nWeb Science also often involves the use of qualitative methods, such as interviews and surveys, to understand the human experience of the web. This can include studying the ways in which people use the web, the impact of the web on society and culture, and the ways in which people interact with each other online.\n\nWeb Science research often focuses on a range of different domains, including social media, e-commerce, online education, and health care. It is an interdisciplinary field, and researchers often collaborate with experts from a variety of fields, such as computer science, sociology, and economics, to tackle complex problems and issues related to the web.\n\nOverall, Web Science is a broad and rapidly evolving field, with a focus on understanding the complex social, technical, and economic systems that make up the web, and the ways in which these systems impact society and individuals.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n### A Quick Introduction to the concept of Social Machines\n\nThe Luminary in the field, James Hendler, wrote a book about [\"Social Machines: The Coming Collision of Artificial Intelligence, Social Networking, and Humanity\"](https://g.co/kgs/FjikkY) .  \n\nBelow is a video that is available in relation to his works sometime ago, that may make more sense to others now...\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVkhX5t98Ls\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIMHO: Generally speaking, the field of work that is structured to in-turn make use of the deep knowledge of different diciplinary areas of thoughtful consideration, as to support the growth of a form of intentional design - in activities that relate to the fabrication of technologies that societies become inextricably linked to, is described as 'Web Science'.\n\nWeb Science works, is in-particular - a significant part of the field of work of Web Civics.  \n\nOne of the greatest areas of 'Web Science' is AI and in-turn also, the work i've been doing that is in-turn instrumental to the architecture of Webizen, as to support [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]].   Nonetheless, the underlying nature of Webizen is that it is a form of Social Machine that is sought to be intentionally designed to provide the sorts of Artificial Minds that we want, rather than providing an opportunity to be influenced by harmful robots. \n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/InformationTheory/AppliedCategoryTheory/","title":"Category Theory"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Category Theory\n\n**Category theory** is a general theory of [mathematical structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure \"Mathematical structure\") and their relations that was introduced by [Samuel Eilenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Eilenberg \"Samuel Eilenberg\") and [Saunders Mac Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saunders_Mac_Lane \"Saunders Mac Lane\") in the middle of the 20th century in their foundational work on [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology \"Algebraic topology\"). Nowadays, category theory is used in almost all areas of mathematics, and in some areas of [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\"). In particular, many constructions of new [mathematical objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object \"Mathematical object\") from previous ones, that appear similarly in several contexts are conveniently expressed and unified in terms of categories. Examples include [quotient spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(disambiguation) \"Quotient space (disambiguation)\"), [direct products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_product \"Direct product\"), [completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completion_(disambiguation)#Mathematics \"Completion (disambiguation)\"), and [duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(mathematics) \"Duality (mathematics)\").  [Source WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory).\n\n### Applied Theory\n\nMany of the issues that are part of common discourse online relating to issues like that are defined as `fake news`, `disinformation` or similar are considered to more accurately be described as a categorisation issue, where the classification of the content is not described in a manner that could or would otherwise be described as [[FitForPurpose]].\n\nSo, a work purporting to be a `#NonFiction` `#NewsArticle` that is sought by the publisher / author, to be consumed as a contribution towards a person (observers) beliefs about the facts of a situation; whilst containing errors or statements that are not grounded in `Reality` may otherwise be defined as a work of fiction, rather than non-fiction; and in-turn there are an array of genre's and other classification tools (categories) that can be applied to the entire document and/or parts of the document or artifact.  Therein, there's not really any such things as `disinformation` rather its misclassified information.\n\nThese sorts of semantics define the difference between `knowledge` systems vs. `information` systems; as are otherwise illustrated by the image provided below;\n\n![[Diagram8.jpg]]\n\nThis diagram is intended to be intepreted by starting at the consciousness point; whereby there is then a choice about whether to create `knowledge systems` or `information systems` and this choice leads to consequential implications.  \n\nAs such, the webizen environment seeks to employ ontologies that are able to be used within documents to declare the intended characteristics of various elements within artifacts.   This is in-turn intended also to be foundationally employable via [[TemporalSemantics]] that are intended to support the causal process through which new or unpopular concepts may be subject to attacks, but then later found to be accurate.  the distinction becomes; defining what the author / human agent / agent intended the document to state; and how they may in-turn be judged in connection to those statements overtime. "},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/InformationTheory/Centricity/","title":"Centricity"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Concept of 'centricity' refers to structuring a way of thinking about the socially-interactive semantics layers.  This conceptual framework seeks to provide support for the values frameworks the webizen environments are built to support.  In-effect, providing some of the foundational considerations or 'tenants' to a form of moral framework, that helps to inform design requirements.\n\n### Human Centric\nThe development of any tools, whether it be companies or things; is intended to support the needs of humanity and/or members of our human family, and through us, our Social Spheres([SocioSphereOntologies](SocioSphereOntologies.md)) and the use of resources, our role in our Biosphere ([BiosphereOntologies](BiosphereOntologies.md)).  No other form of agent can be sent to prison.  The responsibility for what occurs in our world is fundamentally held by Human Beings.  \n\nWhilst there are always complexities involved in almost any circumstance and indeed also the evaluation of that circumstance by others; the fundamental role of technology is to provide useful tools for human beings, to improve and manage their relationships with other agents; both as an active natural agent, and as an observer.  \n\n### Agent Centric\n\nThe term Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'.\n\nIt is noted that in some juristictions the term 'person' may refer to a natural person (human being) or a 'legal personality' (Incorporated Entity (such as a company) / legal person). \n\nIn legal terms, an agent is defined to mean;\n*One who agrees and is authorized to act on behalf of another, a principal, to legally bind an individual in particular business transactions with third parties pursuant to an agency relationship.*\n\nSource: https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/agent\n\nAs such, the term 'agent' is intended to provide a distinction between the entity, person or 'actor' (ie: software / \"Ai Agent\") that is performing some sort of task or activity; and the role in which that agent is undertaking that task.  \n\nWhilst there are many senarios where the concept of Agent Centric semantics apply, one example is;\n\n*a natural person in their own private capacity may hold some particular belief or moral position about something, circumstance, etc.  If they are acting on behalf of an employer or other entity; they may be required to carry out tasks in a particular way that may not be of their own choosing.*  \n\n### Entity Centric\n\nEntity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.).  \n\nThis is interactive with both agent and human centric semantics; whilst seeking to support a structural framework around defining how systems are developed to support a means to associate the activities, rights and responsibilities of an entity as does exist in our offline socio-economic world, to be supported in being able to maintain the same principles based structure online, in webizen environments. \n\n\n## CLASSES OF WEBIZEN\n\nThe concept of a ‘webizen’ is intended to be about ‘helper’ robots, sometimes described as ‘side-kicks’, ‘assistants’ or similar.  Part of the objective is to support the preservation of freedom of thought for natural persons, as is an instrumental foundation required for any form of #HumanRights \n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ND1AZwifZ81MndxyJf81oLaiY5FBUs7aZpFF9u2DxETqCW2tDB0kxwGPay7FqLKiBcSLyAD1er9LXW9BX4NBwFWEJsPPLf3-3_GkcfZkf_RjuuLWezRwl52Locum9Hl7DNPk-ePPWJS_CBSbadrnRuVRWh1dtTwsBz3-AfAAzQaX6aEVzHYGZjyUGg3i)\n\nIn recent works, Dave Raggett speaks about Artificial Minds which is where the term is drawn from; in-turn linked to work on Cognitive AI\n\nAt the moment, i’m creating an index of many different known types of ‘[artificial minds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit?usp=sharing)’ some of which are evil, others aren’t necessarily evil - perhaps good - but still not considered to be a form of ‘webizen’ in a manner consistent with the intended meaning of the concept. \n\nA ‘Webizen’ is intended to be software, that may be packaged with hardware - that is sold to a person, as a product, that they own.  The ambition is to define an open-standards based software ‘stack’, that may involve creating new technologies that will sought to be supported as open-standards; as a safety / security measure; whilst providing a proprietary & Branded Version of the concept, as ‘webizen’.  A Webizen is designed to be - Your AI ‘thing’, it is designed to be your advocate, your assistant, your AI ‘thing’ in the world; that can help you with various stuff online.\n\n\n### Webizen for Groups and incorporated entities (ie: businesses) & “Personas”\n\nWebizen for groups / ‘persona’ considers the idea, that people be furnished a capacity to separate their ‘work life’ from their ‘personal life’; and that in-turn also, businesses / brands, have their own agents that rely upon the human beings directing them often involving more than one ‘vote’ / person; which is in-turn, a concept premised upon the ability for natural persons to have ‘agency’ and that they extend that ‘agency’ through the roles they play, with ‘group works’ of various kinds.  \n  \n“Group Webizen” will require different rules; that relate the functionality of what they do, to support various forms of ‘ethics’ charters - that in-turn, both assist the human beings involved in the group; but also, act to ensure that human beings are responsible for the impacts group work has upon human beings.\n\n-   Improve productivity: curating & share resources and to help curate tasks that are happening\n    \n-   Helping with research and other capacities that groups of people do together.\n    \n-   Protect & support the relationship between ‘natural persons’ and ‘group activity’ related ‘assets’ or ‘things’ / outcomes.  \n    \n-   Support the ability for ‘group instruments’ to be managed via ‘group policies’, etc. \n    \n-   Improve the ability for ‘Group Entities’ to maintain control over their IP / Security / Assets.\n    \n-   Be made able to operate in a federated manner with webizen infrastructure owned by individuals; including but not limited to, creating secure networking & local work platforms.\n    "},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/InformationTheory/DataVsQuads/","title":"Data Vs. Quads"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Data Vs. Quads\n\n#### Data vs. Information & Ideas vs. Concepts / IP.\n\nIt has irritated me for a very long time that there have been various social forces that have sought us to accept that everything electronic is simply 'data', when that type of characterisation has an array of implied implications.   \n\nData, is not protectable via copyright and/or intellectual property law; as such, no 'claim' is able to be made on data.\n\n`01101001 01101110 01100110 01101111 01110010 01101101 01100001 01110100 01101001 01101111 01101110 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01101110 01101111 01110100 00100000 01100100 01100001 01110100 01100001 00101110`\n\nFWIW: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html can be used to convert the data to text (information, depending on whether you understand the language that the text is written in...).  \n\nInformation is protectable in relation to copyright, which is the reason why the code produced by people requires a licensing agreement of some form in-order to be lawfully entitled to use it; in association to the terms outlined in that licensing agreement or one that is otherwise obtained separately.\n\nThis is one of the many reasons why I have been so adamant that the work that I have done is not 'free' or simply an 'idea', even if it is done in manner that is inspectable as an 'open source' methodology via platforms that only provide 'open access' without much consideration for either people nor energy.  The work that I & others have done is not merely 'data' - but rather, it is 'information' - and as such, it is protectable via copyright and/or intellectual property law.\n\nTherefore; rather than using the term 'data' in the manner that is otherwise most readily employed, a preference is to define a term that denotes the difference between data and information. As such, the term 'Quad's' is used to denote an information unit.  The term Quads is comprehensible to those who watch star-trek as well as those who understand RDF / Semantic Web systems; and the concept of a Triple or Quad Store.  In this case, it will refer to Quad Stores that are used to store information.  Therefore the term 'Quads' is sought to be used to define information, as is distinct to an ideology that may otherwise reduce a persons life to 'data' for gainful purposes - particularly employable by those with the expertise to understand exactly why they're electing to do so.  \n\nSimilarly; yet distinct also, The term 'idea' is often used as the means to protect an idea is not reasonably achieved in the interests of humanity generally at large.  Ideas, should be free; but in a manner that is not unlike the problem with information (or knowledge) being called 'data'; the human equivalence is that a persons work (therein implicitly also, their life) is reduced to the concept of it being an 'idea' that is in-turn expressed as 'data'.  \n\nOne of the elements required to address this problem; is to start by ensuring there is a clear distinction between 'data' and 'information' by way of employing the concept of 'quads'; which is in-turn a foundational requirement to support the notion of 'knowledge'. These considerations, are then extended to associate also to temporal and other broader considerations to better support human factors relating to consciousness, creativity, work and related considerations.\n\nTherefore; whilst this is a newly applied concept, the term 'quads' will be used where possible to describe aspects that relates to quad-sources.  \n\nHere is an example of a RDF Quad or [n-Quad](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/) that makes a statement about spiderman:\n\n`<http://example.org/#spiderman> <http://www.perceive.net/schemas/relationship/enemyOf> <http://example.org/#green-goblin> <http://example.org/graphs/spiderman> .`\n\nHere is the same statement expressed in a JSON-LD format:\n\n`{ \"@id\": \"http://example.org/#spiderman\", \"http://www.perceive.net/schemas/relationship/enemyOf\": { \"@id\": \"http://example.org/#green-goblin\" }, \"@graph\": \"http://example.org/graphs/spiderman\" }`\n\nHere is the same statement expressed in binary:\n\n`00111100 01101000 01110100 01110100 01110000 00111010 00101111 00101111 01100101 01111000 01100001 01101101 01110000 01101100 01100101 00101110 01101111 01110010 01100111 00101111 00100011 01110011 01110000 01101001 01100100 01100101 01110010 01101101 01100001 01101110 00111110 00100000 00111100 01101000 01110100 01110100 01110000 00111010 00101111 00101111 01110111 01110111 01110111 00101110 01110000 01100101 01110010 01100011 01100101 01101001 01110110 01100101 00101110 01101110 01100101 01110100 00101111 01110011 01100011 01101000 01100101 01101101 01100001 01110011 00101111 01110010 01100101 01101100 01100001 01110100 01101001 01101111 01101110 01110011 01101000 01101001 01110000 00101111 01100101 01101110 01100101 01101101 01111001 01001111 01100110 00111110 00100000 00111100 01101000 01110100 01110100 01110000 00111010 00101111 00101111 01100101 01111000 01100001 01101101 01110000 01101100 01100101 00101110 01101111 01110010 01100111 00101111 00100011 01100111 01110010 01100101 01100101 01101110 00101101 01100111 01101111 01100010 01101100 01101001 01101110 00111110 00100000 00111100 01101000 01110100 01110100 01110000 00111010 00101111 00101111 01100101 01111000 01100001 01101101 01110000 01101100 01100101 00101110 01101111 01110010 01100111 00101111 01100111 01110010 01100001 01110000 01101000 01110011 00101111 01110011 01110000 01101001 01100100 01100101 01110010 01101101 01100001 01101110 00111110 00100000 00101110`\n\nAs these examples demonstrate; there is a difference between 'data' and information; as such, information sources are intended to be formatted natively as Quads and thereby also defined as Quads.  Notwithstanding, the fact that quads, may be converted into json or other formats as required by the application interfaces; the difference really is, that the information is not merely 'data' - but rather, it is 'information' - and as such, it is protectable via copyright and/or intellectual property law. These sorts of considerations are important in the natural world and its various socio-economic systems; and as such, it is important to ensure that the digital world acts to protect the needs of entities that exist in the natural world, and in-turn those that exist within the legal and/or socio-economic domain; in a manner that is consistent with the needs of natural world entities.\n\n## Backwards compatibility\n\nAs is otherwise noted; it is important that systems are designed to provide a capacity for people to be able to leave the webizen environment and take their 'data' to a platform that defines what they require in those terms.  This is important for a number of reasons; but the most important is that it is important to ensure that people are not locked into a system that is not able to provide the functionality that they require."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/InformationTheory/Nomenclature/","title":"Nomenclature"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Nomenclature\n\n**Nomenclature** ([UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English \"British English\"): [/nəˈmɛŋklətʃɜːr/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\"), [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English \"American English\"): [/ˈnoʊmənkleɪtʃər/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\"))[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature#cite_note-1)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature#cite_note-2) is a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System \"System\") of [names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names \"Names\") or terms, or the rules for forming these terms in a particular field of arts or sciences.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature#cite_note-3) The principles of naming vary from the relatively informal [conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_conventions \"Naming conventions\") of everyday speech to the internationally agreed principles, rules and recommendations that govern the formation and use of the specialist terms used in scientific and any other disciplines.[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature#cite_note-4) [Source: WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Webizen project will both build upon existing nomenclature and develop and employ new nomenclature. \n\nThis note will define the experimental use of terms and the intended meaning of those terms.

There are 'values credentials', which is basically about defining existing instruments (ie: Human Rights instruments) in RDF; so that the informatics can support validation / consideration, about whether and/or how relationships are managed by people in relation to the concepts outlined in those instruments. Yet to implement, I need to define top-level ontology, and it is important to me that the ecosystem does not classify the informatics environments as subclasses of OWL:Thing.  \n\nThe ecosystem incorporates decentralising ontologies: \n\n- [PermissiveCommons]  \n- [[WhatAreTheCommons]]\n\nAs such; i have an opportunity to redefine it.  The HumanCentricAI 'agent' (webizen, owned by whomever purchases it - which essentially means atm - the underlying database) is designed to operate (privately) on a laptop/desktop (in the first instance); apps are defined in a way that advances the old RWW (read-write-web) works, with a variety of distinctions from solid. \n\n(belief is that the W3C Cognitive AI works will end-up playing an important role, but not sure (how) yet). \n\nInitial implementation target is intended to be done in golang, and likely use:  [[BadWolf]]  (has temporal support). \n\nAs i'm going through and defining 'permissive commons' (decentralised ontologies) there's an opportunity to redefine the structures of how they're made to work. Therein - there's an opportunity to redefine how top-level ontology is defined; and i'm puzzling how this might best be done.  \n\nsome notes: RootConcepts\nTherein - the general idea is that maybe the best approach might be to develop (train) a natural language model that can in-turn be used to define top-level ontology / DB structures.\n\nYet, i've not spent enough time historically getting stuck into the implementation related research areas of either - ML / NN models (ie: what can be done that employs relatively little computational power on a consumer device  - whilst potentially in future, extending to employ neuromorphic processing hardware, etc.); therein also - is this a job for prolog? i found https://github.com/ichiban/prolog which is also written in golang, but atm - idk...\n\nThe other part of the equation - whilst focused merely on English for the POC works; is to what depths any DB structure based upon the English language should go, in-order to seek to ensure limits on unwanted AI 'interference' that poorly impacts 'freedom of thought', etc.\n\n[[ChatGPTDynamicOntology]]\n\nTherein - i ended-up doing an experiment with ChatAI in relation to my surname: \n\n[[AChatGPTExperimentHolborn]]\n  \n( Noting - that I didn't get into the templar stuff, or a variety of other considerations related to the associated puzzle, which is in a much shorter timeframe than is commonly associated with indigenous history, for example - the initial research came about as a consequence of my research into the history of the banking system, as was required for the 'knowledge banking' ecosystem designs - that have since been shown to have failed, due to priorities of those the modelling intended to depend upon to support rule of law, human rights, access to justice, etc.  noting - the ideas about paying 'knowledge workers' UBI - is flawed; as that method, doesn't end-up with tax revenue - in association to piping the useful benefit of works to foreign jurisdictions, even if it is the supported practice engendered by a citizens (local jurisdictional) government).   \n  \nIn anycase; Therein - the main insight that i felt i gained from that experiment (noting - the significance of that 'language model'); was about the importance of the predicates to / of, the english language; as to support better 'sense making'; which in-turn, has both geospatial and temporal attributes that end-up being informed by historical (\"SpaceTime\") events, etc.   \n\nIn that example; research about the history of the name and related historical events, seemed to indicate that 'holborn' (outside the city of london, that had a role with the 'old temple' and in-turn also the inns of court (when sought to be placed outside the walls of the city of london) noting also; that various types of people, weren't automatically allowed inside the walls of londinium...) had a more complex history than told in relation to the doomsday book.  \n  \nI guess; this was intended to be a relatively simple example, of the broader problem; about 'knowledge systems modelling' and the underlying 'opportunity' that relates to how the foundational 'top level ontology' might now be modelled in a way that addresses issues that were either too hard decades ago - or set aside, due to the nature of the situation at the time."},{"fields":{"slug":"/WebScience/Observer/Thought/","title":"Thought"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\"brainwaves of god\"\n\nCollective subconscious\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/FunctionalDesigns/SpatioTemporal/DIDSSICOVIDSONGLINES/Tooling/","title":"Tooling"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The way the beginnings of this project has been started, was through the use of the [KnightLab Timeline](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) tool.  This requires the user to get the information and populate the timeline.   This is discussed in [[TheTimelinesProject]].  \n\none of the considerations is how to form a decentralised methodology for storing information.  this is directly tied to the requirements for [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] generally.  As GIT has qualities that include how it is in-effect, decentralised, the assumption is presently that a git / http based method, is worthy of investigation.\n\nA tool that is being explored is: https://github.com/AKSW/QuitStore \n\nAs a consequence of the large-scale employment of DIDs, a solution that makes use of them increasingly appears to be a requirement; although, the hope is, that significant changes will occur in future to the way these 'identifiers' are designed to function & in-turn be employed.\n\nAs is exampled by github and other git related platforms; information can be presented to HTTP for read-purposes; but for write and permissions related purposes, authentication is required.  GIT employs both PGP and SSH.  Which is thereby being explored.\n\nhttps://github.com/WebCivics/did-method-git\nhttps://github.com/WebCivics/did-method-ssh\n\nThere may be some benefit in seeking to form an integration between the QuitStore works and a GIT related method; with or without the SSH related method being coupled (integrated) or loosely coupled (separate method).\n\nIn-terms of then how to form a discovery method; the answer to this is still unclear. \n\nIt may be that a method could use bit-torrent and/or magnet links.\n\nAnother method that might also be interesting is to use gun.eco, however this hasn't yet been explored.\n\nWhilst the initial process is focused upon public information; the objective purpose is to end-up with a soltion that can be effectively advanced to support presentations involving private and sensitive information. \n\n### UI / UX \nThe User-Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) methodology; is unclear presently.  The considerations will be described in more detail in the [[SpaceTimeAppRequirements]] note, that will in-turn provide a better definition of what the requirements and challenges will become.\n\n### Ingest Tools\nThe process of manually finding references then adding them, is time-consuming, and also not necessarily supportive of any underlying probity / verifiability requirements; that relates to whether or not the linked resources remain available as an exact copy of the original doc.\n\nThis is thought to invoke considerations about two aspects; the first, is that there should be a methodology that supports the means to make a back-up, which in-turn relates also to the broader [[PermissiveCommonsRequirements]].  The second, is that there should be some sort of browser plugin or app, that accelerates the means to add records and related informatics.\n\nThere are potentially two somewhat optimal solutions to be considered.\n\nthe first, is some sort of browser-plugin; however, this may not provide the 'best path' towards delivering a fit-for-purpose outcome; as such, the alternative is to look to advance the browser project, likely using the beaker-browser foundations; but, this is to be examined.\n\n### Semantic parsing\nEach document has an array of key topics and concepts; which should be able to be semantically tagged, so that records can be collated in a way that benefits from semantic enrichment of the documents,  and therefore also, the ability to represent complexities.\n\nHistorically, there were examples of how this could be achieved online; however, i cannot find them quickly anymore, some links, no-longer exist.  \n\nThe objective process may require a means to form a local methodology, that would be built using semantic web ontologies that exist presently; rather than seeking to use sense related methods that this project is in-turn seeking to be a stepping stone towards bringing about.\n\nThere are a few different types of challenges relating to different types of media; but the focus will start with english text documents, and therafter also, related media.  The methodology should be considerate of the future need, to ensure multi-lingual support.\n\n### HyperMedia packages\nthe results end-up with a requirement to produce a version of the 'hypermedia packages'.. This would include the means to store the original artifacts, alongside files for discovery and semantic notations; and representation of the content.  \n\n## Issues & confusion\nThe first point relating to 'issues' and indeed also, my 'confusion', is that this project relates to the HumanCentricAI works, the Webizen works, WebCivics works more broadly; as well as, consequentially, the peace infrastructure project and trust factory works.  Its a fairly instrumental piece of the puzzle to solve.   Yet, the means to address the 'sense' issue, is absolutely  enhanced through the development of these works; as the applied experiment / tests, upon [[DIDSSICOVIDSONGLINES]] use-case, is far simplier; than the languages of our human family, overtime, space, place, events, etc.  as needs to be provided a fabric of support, for use with Ai Agents, of which, i am particularly focused upon the Webizen works.\n\nWhilst being supportive on a best efforts basis, with others seeking implementations broadly.\n\nTherein - the particular topic, is intended to support better comprehension of what exactly it is that they've been making and whom it is therefore assumed to be 'fit for purpose' to be applied upon.  notwithstanding the comprehension, that it raises, sensitive topics; for which, insights are considered to be helpful for the very many, even if not desired by the very few. \n\nI think the repo should be in Web Civics; and that, the matter of the destination of the documention be reserved, noting that the project is deemed important for the sense project.\n\nThe docs will be added to [[TheTimelinesProject]] folder, and then associated with the the practice method insights associated with the [[DIDSSICOVIDSONGLINES]] POC insights.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/FunctionalDesigns/SpatioTemporal/TheTimelinesProject/BrowserFunctionality/","title":"BrowserFunctionality"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nOne way or another, a means to quickly obtain records is absolutely helpful.

Yet, there is a long-history of related works and links that i'll add to the Work Project folder at some stage (when i get to it)...\n\nThe Work project is perhaps one of the most essential elements to the broader [[Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject]], including but not limited to; the enabling works described as being constituencies of [[Web Civics]] alongside that of [[Webizen]], are intended to produce an environment that supports the means to provide economic models that better support the needs of those who are primarily engaged in fields of [[KnowledgeWork]] in particular; yet, the methodologies have an array of other applications more broadly.\n\nThese other usecases will seek to consider producing a means to provide tools for people whose lives would be benefited if they were more easily able to manage their ability to engage with a multitude of employers and those whose type of work involves multiple clients  providing payments for their services; alongside other use-cases more broadly.  however, the fundamental requirement of the work prject, is to support both; the works relating to the development of [[Web Civics]], which will continue to develop works that are more focused on [[WhatIsWebScience]] activities; alongside, [[Webizen]] and the [[WebizenAlliance]] requirements as the priority, as the means to do anything else hinges upon the ability to produce a platform that is designed to be made able to support how any other forms of work are able to be done, using it.  As such; the critical technical requirements are part of the [[Webizen 3.0]] project, with significant improvements expected through the use of this platform, to produce the [[Webizen 3.5]] solutions; and related works that are hoped to emerge through the growth of participants doing useful works (or works that are hoped to become useful) on the initial platform tools.\n\n## Commercial Structures\n\nThe Work Project seeks firstly; to support a framework where all forms of [[ProjectFinancing]] are treated equally.  that is, that if unpaid or funded work is undertaken by someone and the useful derivatives of that contribution are useful; then, they're treated in the same way as any other investor - subject to an array of particular terms, to better contextualise the nature of the circumstance, etc.  This seeks to engender rules that basically act to support 'good faith relations' in a manner that attends to the derivatives of [[TheValuesProject]] structurally.\n\nWhilst derivative implications end-up with a requirement for [[BiosphereOntologies]] and [[SocioSphereOntologies]] to provide support for [[Micropayments]] systems (in particular), the architecture is intended to be broadly ***'Project Orientated'***, as to support a means to couple the relationship between the useful thing that has been produced and the socioeconomics that relates to its lifecycle as a #thing.\n\nThereafter, there is an array of [[ContributionClassifications]] that are importantly defined which then have implications on the [[WorkValuationMethods]] and in-turn also, the licensing frameworks.  \n\nThere are an array of [[SocialAttackVectors]] that will directly target these constituencies of the ecosystem.  It is important that there are both clear rules and systems in place to address disputes.  \n\nThe [[LicensingFrameworks]] will be particularly attentive to circumstances in which works relate to the fundemental rights of Human Beings (ie: Core [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]] ); and will distinguish between natural persons (human beings), organisations with reduced means vs. users who are enterprise, large corporations, Government and other similar sorts of entities whose nature is different and that there is a capacity to form licensing frameworks for those types of users in a manner that distinguishes their obligations differently to those of others. \n\nThis type of mechanism is intended to provide the means to support [[KnowledgeWork]] compensation for the development and creation of tooling that is required to support the foundational requirements of tooling relating to the [[Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject]] in a manner that seeks compensatory revenues (income) from organisations; whom, for example, may be defined as having a cash flow of above $3m AUD Per Annum or by way of structural identity frameworks (ie: in circumstances where analysis is not feasible); as may be determined by a [[WebizenAlliance]] provider; whilst, \n\nProviding the derivative tooling free of charge to all other users.  \n\nIn other circumstances; where the work-derivative is some sort of 'optional' #thing then the cost may be collected from all users at some rate defined by the projects leaders; but that, the overall compensatory amount is sought to be built upon a fixed return for the total effort calc (ie: [[ProjectFinancing]] ); for whatever that body of work is defined as being.  In some cases, work will continue to provide new versions and/or additional maintainence and support for whatever that thing is; which in-turn, ends-up being attributed to the economic frameworks associated with that thing.\n\nWhilst conceptually supported; yet not at all the focus at present, if someone invents something that is entirely optional, as in - its a market based product that might be distinct, yet, a persons life (ie: [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]] ) are not going to be disaffected by not having it; then, whoever sells it is entirely entitled to seek to charge whatever they want; and if people want to pay for it, that's really upto them.  as they say 'its a free market'; yet, these sorts of considerations do not apply to works that are critical for [[Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject]] related purposes.  \n\n**Donations**: if people want to make donations or gift to persons above and beyond the project related economic protocols; that's also find, but also not sought to be required.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/HumanCentricAI/LearningModals/","title":"Learning Modals"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Learning Modals\n\n## How to define Learning?\n\nLearning is the process of acquiring new knowledge, skills, behaviors, or attitudes through experience, study, or training. Learning can take place in a variety of contexts, including in formal educational settings, such as schools or universities, or informally, through life experiences or self-directed study.\n\nThere are many different approaches to learning, and people learn in different ways. Some people may learn more effectively through hands-on experience, while others may learn better through reading or listening to lectures.\n\nLearning can be a continuous process that occurs throughout a person's life, as they encounter new situations and experiences that challenge them to learn and adapt. It can also be a deliberate process, as people may seek out learning opportunities in order to acquire new knowledge or skills.\n\nOverall, learning is a fundamental aspect of human development and is essential for personal and professional growth and success.\n\n### The Use of Open Badges with Webizen\n\n[[OpenBadges]]  can be used to provide recognition of prior learning for knowledge workers via systems that support Webizen AI agents in a number of ways:\n\n1.  Recognition of skills and expertise: AI agents can be used to assess the skills and expertise of knowledge workers and issue Open Badges to recognize their learning and achievements. This can help to provide evidence of skills and abilities that may be difficult to demonstrate through traditional methods.\n    \n2.  Verification of learning: Open Badges can be used to verify the learning and achievements of knowledge workers, helping to ensure that their skills and expertise are accurately represented.\n    \n3.  Portability of learning: Open Badges can be easily shared and displayed on a variety of online platforms, making it easier for knowledge workers to share their learning and achievements with others. This can be particularly useful for knowledge workers who may work in a variety of different settings or who may be seeking to demonstrate their skills to potential employers or clients.\n    \n\nOverall, Open Badges can be a useful tool for providing recognition of prior learning for knowledge workers via systems that support AI agents, helping to provide evidence of skills and expertise and making it easier to share learning and achievements with others.\n\n\n### Objective\n\nThe objective is to improve the way people are able to be supported by recgonition of prior learning applications of [[CognitiveAI]] tooling.  These systems will seek to develop an evidence base to support a conclusion that a person can be asserted to have knowledge of concepts, things, fields of expertise and other factors of importance in relation to the performance of new work activities, as is in-turn made possible by the prior performance of activities. \n\nIn-part, what this constituency seeks to form a means to address, relates to innovation in particular; but also, an array of other socio-economic and governance factors.  \n\nWithin the field of innovation, people work on new ideas that form new 'things', of various types.  Yet traditional / historical means of qualification have been mostly focused upon the use of academic facilities; who do not offer qualifications about the knowledge of a field that is presently being invented.  The consequence is that the people who were instrumental to the creation of a new field of expertise, are subsequently not considered to be qualified in the area and consequentially; both, discriminated against due to not having done a course relating to the field (only available later); and in-turn somewhat forced to pay 'rents' to obtain qualifications for an area that they may have been involved in creating / inventing!.\n\nThe commonly accepted solution for this problem, is to simply pay the 'rents' or suffer the consequences.\n\nThe other area illustrated, about improving [[ESG]] support (in-effect); is that projects that are run by groups may in-turn nominate a person to take-on a role that they are not competently equipped to perform; and as a consequence of these sorts of practices, harms may in-turn be incurred by others - that may well be of a kind, that has no appropriate available lawful remedy.  \n\nIn a similar yet different area; a person may be charged with the responsibility of providing an analysis of a situation and acting or failing to act in a circumstance that has material consequences upon others; but they've not got the skills to comprehend some sort of important facts, due to a lack of skills or knowledge in that area.  Consequentially the person may act negligently and/or engage in - what is in-effect - an act of violence, and then seek protection at a later time, irraspective of the consequences put upon others.  At which stage, the situation may in-turn become adverserial and the victim is unlikely to be resourced with lawful remedy, compensation and/or even simply an otherwise appropriate apology and whatever further actions may need to take place in-order to resolve the consequences of that persons mistakes; as was in-turn put, upon others.  These sorts of situations undermine 'good faith' relations and in-turn often invoke further wrong-doings as the mistakes of one person, may in-turn lead to an array of other persons seeking to cover up and/or protect the wrong-doer, irraspective of whether it was an honest mistake or a willful act of violence causing injury.\n\nSo the learning modals, seek to support sense-making to more rapidly produce contextually useful insights and related links that support a means to process the circumstances of a persons learning and seek to mitigate risks of events that may lead to disputes and/or [[SocialAttackVectors]] that may negatively impact a legal entities [[ESG]] and/or insurability status.\n\nAdditionally, the objective is to produce systems that can provide categorised qualification  [[SemWebOntologies]] and [[TemporalSemantics]] that is in-turn intended to support [[CognitiveAI]] processes (noting the importance of: [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] ) and thereby providing support for [[VerifiableClaims&Credentials]] in relation to this field of [[WebScience]] and its means to address various [[SocialFactors]].\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/HumanCentricAI/PersonalOntology/","title":"Personal Ontology"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Personal Ontology\n\nThe webizen environment effectively produced tooling that is in-effect empowering the means for people to singificantly improve how they consciously engage in defining their own personal ontology - that is, who they are as people; and in-turn, how other agents 'percieve' qualia of relational importance to them.  \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHl0ThG2kNU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n#### Prof. LUCIANO FLORIDI - ChatGPT, Superintelligence, Ethics, Philosophy of Information\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YLNGvvgq3eg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/HumanCentricAI/QuantumInformatics/","title":"QuantumInformatics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Tricky topic.

Those involved, have extrodinary skills and expertise in a variety of areas, which are in-turn associated with roles of significance internationally via various venues.  \n\nIt is my hope that members of this group may usefully contribute when it is appropriate to do so.  in the meantime, this document will seek to provide some relatively basic information.\n\n### Chat GPT\n\n> Q: How would you define the science of consiousness?\n\n*The science of consciousness is the study of the nature of consciousness, or the subjective experience of being aware of one's thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws on research and theories from a range of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science.*\n\n*In the science of consciousness, researchers aim to understand the neural basis of consciousness, the relationship between the brain and consciousness, and the ways in which consciousness arises and evolves. They also study the various forms of consciousness that exist, such as wakefulness, sleep, and altered states of consciousness, and the ways in which consciousness can be altered or influenced by external factors.*\n\n*The science of consciousness is a complex and difficult field, and there is still much that is not understood about the nature of consciousness. However, advances in neuroscience and other fields have led to a greater understanding of the neural basis of consciousness, and researchers continue to make progress in understanding the nature of this elusive and fundamental aspect of human experience.*\n\n### Ontology and Human Dignity\n\nWhilst it is important to understand the intended meaning of ontologies, as does relate to a particular set of tooling that provides a particular series of practical capabilities.  This does in-turn relate also to [[UnderstandingOntologies]] more broadly. \n\nIn relation to the designs of [[SemanticWeb]] [[SemWebOntologies]] the vast majority of ontologies are built on-top of [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) family of ontologies, whereby the modern version is [OWL 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/).  These ontologies are built into many of the leading Semantic Web Ontology tools, and whilst not mandatory - it is difficult to create alternatives other than via manual means - as least, that's been my experience so far.  The Top Level concept in OWL is 'Thing'; and whilst this is usefully applied to every `owl:thing` the appropriateness of employing this term to provide support for [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI]] and  [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] which thereby also needs to figure out how to describe aspects relating to [[Human Consciousness]] in a manner that is not sought to be described in a way whereby a `owl:thing` may have a possessive relationship over natural persons, is fairly critical to the requirements for the [[TheValuesProject]] and related semantics.\n\nThis field of work is enormously complex; and discussions about it in good faith, often leads to difficulties that are fundamental to a persons own sense of being; which whilst sought to be rendered support in ways that are morally appropriate, the broader implications are often poorly understood generally; and there is some discussion about the sorts of implications that are sought to be addressed in the document about [[SocialAttackVectors]].\n\nThe broader belief is, that the ability to address these sorts of very complex issues will only really become more pragmatically feasible once [[Webizen3.0]] is employable with [[WebizenApps]] that can support such things as [[HyperMediaContainers]] that enable persons whose skills are remarkable; but that they're expertise is not in developing modern computer software; more specifically, as a software programmer. \n\nAnother part of the means through which this important are of consideration is sought to be addressed in manner that should minimally improve upon the circumstances of how AI (online platforms) work today; will be emboided in the [[SemWebOntologies]] and [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] related works (inclusive to: [[TemporalSemantics]] ); and, the information provided about that work will help to inform how i will update and improve this document, in future.\n\nIn the meangtime; i've asked [OpenGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) / OpenAI for its point of view; per below,\n\n##### OpenAi \n\n> Q: *Define what is a personal ontology - as does relate to the use of AI and the nature of how a human being is defined both by themselves and their environment, including socio-economic influences*\n\n*A: A personal ontology is an individual's understanding of the nature of reality and the concepts that exist within it. It reflects an individual's beliefs, values, and assumptions about the world and their place within it, and it is shaped by their personal experiences, cultural and social context, and education.*\n\n*Personal ontologies can be complex and multifaceted, and they can vary significantly from person to person. They can also change and evolve over time as an individual's experiences and understanding of the world changes.*\n\n*In the context of AI, personal ontologies can be relevant in several ways. For example, an AI system that is designed to interact with humans may need to take into account the personal ontologies of its users in order to effectively communicate and understand their needs and preferences. In addition, the design of an AI system may be influenced by the personal ontologies of the designers, reflecting their values and assumptions about the world and the role of AI in it.*\n\n*Socio-economic influences can also shape personal ontologies, as an individual's economic and social status can shape their experiences and understanding of the world. For example, an individual's personal ontology may be influenced by their socio-economic background, their education, and the social and cultural norms that they are exposed to. Understanding these influences can be important for designing AI systems that are fair and unbiased, and that are able to effectively serve the needs of a diverse user base.*\n\n*It is also worth noting that personal ontologies can sometimes come into conflict with each other, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts. For example, two individuals with different personal ontologies may have different beliefs or assumptions about the nature of reality, leading to difficulties in communication and understanding.*\n\n*In the context of AI, it is important for designers and users to be aware of these potential conflicts and to take steps to address them. This can include designing AI systems that are able to adapt to and accommodate different personal ontologies, and engaging in dialogue and communication to build shared understanding and resolve misunderstandings.*\n\n*Overall, personal ontologies are an important aspect of human experience and understanding, and they can have significant implications for the design and use of AI systems. It is important for designers and users to be aware of personal ontologies and to consider them in the design and use of AI systems in order to ensure that they are effective and fair.*\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/HumanCentricAI/ValuesProject/","title":"The Values Project"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# The Values Project\n\nThis was one of the first documents produced, and likely needs to be comprehensively updated - given the importance of this project.  \n\nTHe ability to deliver the [[valuescred]]\n\nAn artifact from an old project that has continued to provide me something to refer to when feeling lost about the problems that seem to be inexorable, is this short video, which was produced with the help of [Thomas Keneally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Keneally) who wrote the words;

the reality is, that these components are now globally implemented, with increasing market-pressures to deploy / employ them, world-wide. \n\nWhilst a future project might seek to accomplish a similar task using a related, yet (thought to be) distinct method;  producing infrastructure to support the needs of humanity on this ‘SSI platform’ - is likely to mitigate issues that already exist, without proper consideration; and provide a means for markets to consider the implications of ‘features’ it doesn’t easily support today.  The downside is, that there’s a probability it will also advance commercialisation; however when weighing up the factors relating to the situation, it is thought that the commercialisation is not going to slow-down, so, the best thing is to seek to temper some of the issues it has; whilst seeking to build a better pathway, if it is possible to do so overtime.   The broader problem is about ‘technology lock-ins’ being deployed, that are not necessarily good for humanity & its socio-economic moral infrastructure. \n\n# Overview\n\nThe values project is premised upon a desire to ensure people are furnished an opportunity to express terms in relation to online contracts.  This in-turn stimulates the development of a symmetrical agreement framework, rather than asymmetrical, as is the case today - as a consequence of the designs & priorities, illustrated by others at large.\n\nThere is presently no known solution to express ‘values’. There is also no good solution for humans to declare preferences with respect to the collection of information or the storage of profiling related information - such as cookies.  Whereas a relatively simple solution to address the ‘pop-ups’ that appear in websites asking for ‘cookie permissions’ would remove the need for these sorts of things, for users; The ‘values’ frameworks, is intended to provide a capacity for persons to define a set of terms that are expected to be honored; and in-turn, as a consequence of contract law - as is used by electronic services to seek rights, that any breach of contract may result in consequences / penalties / enforceable obligations.   Whilst the basic concept may be employed for purposes not intended (exploits, in-effect - as is personally felt to be the case with the broader ‘platform’ this looks to be deployed with); the purpose of this project at the present-time, is to focus on declarative instruments that are well-known and/or relating to jurisdictional laws.  In particular, the first examples will seek to deploy solutions for SDGs, Human Rights instruments and other ethics related statements of significance for international use.\n\n# Goals\n\n## Technical Goals\n\n1.

To enable end-users to find, collect & use commonly known ‘values statements’; as a way to empower users to usefully engage with others upon a basis of mutually defined & articulated values (rights & rules) that are important to them online.\n    \n4.  The ability to manage the relationships they’ve made online with other legal entities. \n    \n5.  The ability to distribute these assets in a permissively controlled manner via DLT URIs in addition to HTTP(s) uris. \n\n\n## Social Goals\n\n6.  To illustrate & address the issues that act to hinder the useful purpose of ‘digital identity’ to serve & support the rights of persons; rather than being employed to empower rulers above & beyond rights; by forming the infrastructure needed to address how we fix it. \n    \n7.  To provide a capacity to engage in online projects with others via contract law principles on a basis of ‘shared values’; or in-effect, \n    \n\ta.  Legal tools to better manage relationships with others via electronic contracts. \n    \n\tb.  To Support rights & address issues that seek to dismantle our foundational rights.\n    \n\tc.  To improve the basis upon which we are empowered to work together in peace.\n    \n\td.  To support the ability for people to do good work for humanity - in areas, where there may be ‘dual use’ (or similar) implications, that are not sought to be endorsed or furnished meaningful assistance in any way common to intended purposes.\n    \n\n# Specifications - issues\n\nIn writing these ‘specifications’, there’s a few known issues; such as,\n\n-   The nomenclature;  Terms such as ‘wallet’ as to define a person by their ‘wallet’ is not considered desirable.  \n    \n\nThinking ATM; it's more like a persons robot app - R2-D2 or a persons ‘digital twin’ control interface & means to create, store & manage evidence.\n\n-   The differences between what is easily achieved vs. what is hoped to be achieved.  Addressing this issue features implications relating to time / resources / talent.\n    \n-   The hope / desire is to define the ‘minimum viable solution’ to then engage in further development, which is hoped to be exponential in nature overtime.\n    \n-   The broader intended ecosystem - is different to the ‘ssi’ ecosystem model; although, it is also desirable to ensure that any dominant ‘platform solutions’ be made compatible. \n    \n\n# Specifications Goals\n\nThe specification goals seek to outline what it is that the design is attempting to triage.  \n\nThere’s a few components to it.\n\n1.  The way in which the ‘[[SemWebOntologies]]’ are handled generally.\n\ta. [[UnderstandingOntologies]] provides general 'non-technical' information.  \n      \n2.  Ideally, the moral owners of the ‘[[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]]’ would be stewards of those instruments, versions of them, etc.  \n    \n3.  Presently HTTP Uris are used for ontologies - DLT/DHT ontologies are useful; as such, the objective is to implement [[PermissiveCommons]]. SeeAlso; [[PermissiveCommonsTech]]\n    \n4.  [[VerifiableClaims&Credentials]] (including the above noted 'values credentials') are also able to be provided by providers / group entities.\n    \n3. There are presently ‘wallets’ that are defined in a particular way, which is in-turn part of a broader ecosystem that is developing.  \n    \n\ta.  I don’t like the term ‘wallet’.  \n    \n\tb. I am also not confident that the specifications of these ‘wallets’ will be ‘fit for purpose’, as such changes might need to be made. \n    \n\tc. There is a desire to store an array of digital artifacts via a ‘personal cloud’ (protected by law) solution; that will end-up having alot of ‘important (s/w files) documents’ in it.  This isn’t simply a ‘wallet’ & its not quite to the extent to which (in future) the hope is to end-up producing a capacity that might be termed an inforg.\n\n4.  The solution will require packages that are built for online platforms like wordpress.\n    \n5.  A major part of the intended purpose of these works, is to end-up with a solution that can be used for collaboratively undertaking online projects with others.  This ‘projects’ element, will in-turn require additional functionality.\n    \n6.  There is a requirement also to support ‘verifiable claims’, which may be different to what are now known as ‘verifiable credentials’.  These requirements would include the ability to define characteristics of persons required to engage in projects.\n    \n8.  The ‘values’ credentials are intended to support ‘logic’ processes that will progressively improve support for compliance tracking & relationships between credentials.\n    \n9.  A modeling requirement will be needed, in time, to support arbitration considerations where values stipulated in one of the values' credentials, has considerations that may conflict with others; as evaluated on a situation-specific basis. \n    \n10.  Seniors (in particular) have problems retaining their password / username details for websites, something that is similar to what is known as a ‘password manager’ is required. There is also ‘hearsay’ that suggests government workers in agencies relating to national security & defense, may not be properly (securely) storing their access credential information (ie: putting the information into a document that’s stored on their desktop).\n    \n11.  Designs need to consider how solutions will scale to support the needs of persons whose decisions are able to be made as a consequence of consent by a guardian.  A way to address these sorts of issues was historically attempted through the lens of a ‘pets app’. \n    \n12.  Another use-case of importance (i think) is the ability to support ‘annotations’ on content.\n    \n\n# Specifications Resources & Considerations\n\n I am advised that the US company SpruceID ( [https://github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid) ) has been doing good work. I note in particular, their libraries for a ‘did kit’ and also a ‘did wallet’ solution.  It does not appear that the ‘did’ / ‘ssi’ solution presently supports functionality otherwise produced (earlier) for the education market; whereby notes include,\n\n-   [https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html](https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html)\n    \n-   [https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/](https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/) \n\nWhereby the problem with ‘open badges’ is that they’re very much designed for education / academia; rather than an ability for people to have a similar sort of thing, relating to values.\n\nA related, desirable requirement; is to produce the tooling required to support the means for people to articulate licenses & other terms in relation to work activities online (inc. accrued rights); alongside, a means to support the ability for web-sites, to support membership and/or privacy related ‘credentials’; which would have the effect of addressing two linked issues,\n\n1.  The GDPR pop-up issue could be addressed for users of this ‘Digital Vault’’.\n    \n2.  The ‘membership’ and/or related instruments (could be group instruments / affiliations, etc.) could better support the means to address ‘micro-payments’ use-cases for content that is not otherwise publicly available. \n    \n\nMore sophisticated considerations; relating to ‘cyber security’ / sensitive projects, confidence, etc.\n\n‘[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)\n\nThere are circumstances where people will be bound to obligations (ie: employment or professional obligations) that preclude them from being able to engage on a basis that may otherwise be afforded to them;  support for considerations are important.\n\nThere is also; a significant desire for support for instruments; that may be private and/or sensitive in nature, such as clearances, vetting, police / working with children checks, etc. \n\nThis may also include a requirement to have credentials should there be problems with these sorts of ‘checks’, as may be taken into account by others when seeking to engage in fair-dealings.\n\nAlso - there should be means to address personal & humanitarian related issues; relating to mental health / illness & treatment related characteristics that should seek to better support people who are acting honestly & responsibly, rather than those who deceptively seek gainful benefits otherwise - this is in-turn, not intended to act punitively; rather, to support security.\n\nFinally; the intended ‘cyber security schema’, featured various constituent components to the overarching authentication fabric, which was in-turn an enabler for activity related factors. The effect was, to bring about an ecosystem solution - that is more appropriate for real-world security capabilities - subject to - deployment methodologies, law & operational capabilities. \n\nSome of these more complex considerations are desirable, but perhaps treated differently. \n\nNOTE:  In related work, there are various projects that will be seeking to employ these tools; whilst also, making them available for broader use.   The projects i’m particularly focused on presently are as follows;\n\n1.  An International Peace Infrastructure Project\n    \n2.  A Cyber capabilities project (domestic)\n    \n3.  A ‘community’ app & related ecosystem (for FNQ). \n\n\nWhilst the ‘initial requirements’ for each of these projects do have differences; there are also core requirements that are sought to be employed for all of them; and, as a consequence of ‘human centric designs’, it is expected that at least some people who seek to use this ‘identity solution’ will be involved in all of these projects, alongside many more.  \n\nThe expectation is that there will be an array of authentication & cyber-security technologies used to create a form of ‘informatics fabric’ that seeks to produce a hardened trustworthy environment;  this is not similar to the design of ‘SSI’ & related commercial solutions; yet, the design of the underlying technologies later used for SSI relates to the history of these tools.\n\n## Addressing the ‘social factors’;\n\nThe concept of addressing the social factors has been an on-going ‘discussion’, with little progress; and much of the progress that has been made, done in ways that weren’t ‘all good’.\n\nThere is a vital requirement to set-up a capacity for people to expressly state terms they seek to be employed in the online contracts they enter into online; and in-turn, furnish an opportunity for a market-segment of online services that support this sort of social-ideology, to grow and i believe - flourish.  There are many, many ‘projects’, or jobs / things about peace, human rights - good stuff, areas of work - that needs to be done; but it can’t reasonably be done in a manner that is built upon a propagated belief that the idea of ‘web slavery’ or ‘digital slavery’ or any form of slavery / abuse of human rights & other related values - should be considered fair or reasonable or ok in any way whatsoever - when its clearly not. \n\nThere is a change in modality that is able to be achieved - as is otherwise required - for the ‘more sophisticated use-cases’ alongside the needs of people, who seek a life - of respect, dignity & fairness unto ‘rule of law’, including a capacity to engage with civic (ie: elections) & civics (ie: peace infrastructure, or advocating for means to address social problems / issues) activities…\n\nSome of these requirements do in-turn require a means to have a safe space to store records of importance.   This is presently not very well provided for by existing solutions that now thereby define the nature of the ‘identities’ of the persons who’ve been involved & the values of their groups.  Whilst it is hoped that these sorts of exhibits will be positively influenced through the production of technology - that led to the way things are done today - to be made, to function as intended - it is also expected, that some people will always prefer alternatives for various reasons; in this way, its not unlike the circumstance of ‘freedom of religion’, whereby the concept of choice - is intended to be empowering, and not a device to force others to comply, in circumstances where the implications are knowingly unlawful & without lawful remedy by design. \n\n## The use of PNG or SVG Containers\n\nThe concept is to use PNG, SVG or other suitably defined image formats as a form of container format for [[VerifiableClaims&Credentials]] is a fairly old concept, that was instrumental to the [[OpenBadges]] designs.  The 'image' format (particularly SVG) may be interactive / dynamic or may be static.  The Container would then also include the semantic ontology formatted to support presentation of what that asset communicates both in a human readable form and in a format that can be consumed by software agents (rdf).  \n\nIn the future there may be a better definition for a file-container method that becomes standardized as something other than an SVG; nonetheless, its thought - SVGs will do for now. \n\n## Temporal support\n\nWhilst it is desirable to start with the ‘values credentials’ that have static meanings or are represented in a manner that defines the version (noting - new version of laws emerge all the time, perhaps a qualification URI should check for any new versions as to support validity); as does, the circumstances in which the credential was used.  As such, there are a variety of time-stamps that are important to employ, as to ensure historical records remain accurate.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PCT-EnglishLanguageModelling/","title":"English Language Modelling"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# English Language Modelling\n\n***This Document is a work in progress!***\n\nNOTE: [[UnderstandingOntologies]]\n\nThe objective of this note is to dig into the details of what should be considered when seeking to form a a top-level ontology using natural language, which is applied in this case to the english language (although, not exclusively).\n\n### Language Related Fields of Research\n\n**Etymology** \n**Etymology** ([/ˌɛtɪˈmɒlədʒi/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\") [_ET-im-OL-ə-jee_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key \"Help:Pronunciation respelling key\"))[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology#cite_note-OED-1) is the study of the [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History \"History\") of the [form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_change \"Phonological change\") of [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word \"Word\")[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology#cite_note-2) and, by extension, the origin and evolution of their semantic meaning across time.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology#cite_note-3) It is a subfield of [historical linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics), and draws upon comparative [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics \"Semantics\"), [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics) \"Morphology (linguistics)\"), [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics \"Semiotics\"), and [phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics \"Phonetics\").\n\nSource: [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology)\n\n**Semiotics**\n**Semiotics** (also called **semiotic studies**) is the systematic study of sign processes ([semiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiosis \"Semiosis\")) and meaning making.

This is considered important to figure out what's required and what is considered to be a premium (meaning 'nice to have' / unnecessary) feature.\n\nAs such; the first line of enquiry is focused on seeking to gain a comprehension of what could be done if the resources were not limited technically and/or otherwise.\n\nLooking into the history of the english language, evokes an array of considerations that i think are related to Etymology, Semiotics, Epistemology etc.  \n\n#### SpaceTime Considerations (GeoSpatial & Temporal)\n\nLanguages evolve overtime and in-turn also, relates to places and peoples from different places.  Some of the implications include pictorial languages such as is demonstrated by heraldry whereby the spelling of different words and the general ability to read and write a language was not always common.   \n\nThe ability to develop a language model that seeks to take into consideration the geospatial relationships of where different words are thought to have originated (often) and the notations of time in relation to those known events, can be processed by AI models in ways that cannot be done by human minds alone, even if they've studied a particular subject or topic over many, many years.  Therein also; it takes humans many years to gain even a basic command of a spoken language, and years further to gain knowledge about the use of that language for writing and reading of other peoples works.\n\nLanguages are also, constantly evolving.  As such, the intended meaning of words as were used hundreds and/or thousands of years ago, may be different to the modern meaning of that word or words.   Similarly words are being continually redefined and new words made.\n\n#### The Confluence of Languages\n\nThe english language is not simply 'english', rather, it is made-up of words that come from many other languages and many different peoples from various places, around the world overtime.  The ability to understand the meaning of english words, isn't simply able to be done as well as may otherwise be formed - should the history of those words be considered or be made able to be considered.\n\n#### Specialised Vocabularies & Field Specific Meanings\n\nThere are various industries that make use of language of various forms and in various ways.  \n\nSometimes the meaning that is applied within that professional field; has distinctions to the use of the term in other settings.  As such, the concept topic-field becomes an important attribute when seeking to comprehend the 'meaning' of a statement, that may be employed in relation to a specified field of '[liberal arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education)' profession, skillset or domain. \n\n#### Functional (Software) Language\n\nLanguage sets for the useful production of software, may include definitions about protocols and in-turn also API definitions.   Further definitions could be provided about the meaning of various functions provided by various software languages.  \n\n#### Translations\nA 'gold plated' solution would also be able to support translations between languages with a high-level of accuracy, in real-time. \n\n#### Complex Document \"Graph\" support for AnyURI\n\nA gold plated solution might be able to process the text (or indeed also audio) of any webpage or electronic resource, and support a means to both better manage the history of a persons time spent on a computer, supporting improved recall and perhaps also the ability to archive versions of documents and thereafter support the ability to distinguish between versions of the same resource that may either change; or that the context relating to the content artifact changes, as to result in a different sort of meaning / categorisation of the content artifact; and in-turn perhaps also, any other content artifacts that refer to it.\n\n### SocioEconomic Considerations.\n\nThere is an incredibly high-skilled series of 'jobs' or in-other-words, work, that does continually need to be undertaken and the useful benefit of that work is instrumental. \n\nAs is noted below; there are some solutions that are available as 'open source libraries' yet there are other solutions that are made available on a paid basis.   Given the enormous scope of works that could be done towards supporting the commons / common-sense of computer-humanity language systems, whilst the means to make use of these systems should be free of 'survellience' particularly in relation to private use, the idea that all this work can be done 'for free', isn't considered reasonable or consistant with various practical factors that have a firm footing in reality.  As such, some way of ensuring support for those whose job/skillset/life it is to do language related work, is considered both reasonable and important.  \n\n### Defining AI Related Input.\n\nAs is noted in the [[AgentLabelling]] note; it is important that the technical delivery is designed in such a way that ensures that, by default, the solution identifies which agent was responsible for which words being added to a document or communication artifact or event; This is likely able to be done via markup that is embedded in the content assets, however the exact solution is presently unknown and yet to be more formerally defined.  Whilst part of the consideration relates more specifically to AI (inc 'autocorrect') the same requirement is usefully important for collaborative documents involving many human actors.\n\n### Summary: *\"Gold Plated Solution\"* \n\nWhilst these considerations are not yet exhaustive (ie: there's more), and that i have not got into the database (software) methods and implications - as yet... i note again,\n\nIt is not presently expected that all of these sorts of qualities are going to be achievable nor is it considered that these qualities, characteristics and related considerations are all required in-order to make a significant improvement above and beyond the manner through which systems are made to operate today.  \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PCTProblemStatement/","title":"Problem Statement"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Problem Statement\n\nBelow is a list of different problems that are sought to be considered and addressed in the permissive commons ecosystem solution in an appropriate and/or fit for purpose manner.\n\nThe main reason for adding it here, is to provide it as supporting background notes. \n\nThe objective outcome is to have a specification that is firstly going to be applied for the [[Webizen]] Ecosystem solutions, yet others may take it up and its being designed to support that sort of outcome.\n\nIn the webizen systems, there are agents that are designed using 'artificial intelligence' technologies.  These agents use SemanticWeb technologies - namely, RDF SemWebOntologies, which structures the content in relavent documents and databases in a way that means other systems are able to process that data without needing to produce new APIs (application program interfaces).  Historically, the way these systems have worked is that some groups produce an ontology and then publish it somewhere on the web.  This ontology is then used by other people, processes and systems to structure their electronic documents (databases) so that the information can be consumed by other systems easily. \n\nThese systems have suffered from an array of problems.\n1. The ontologies have either become unavailable on the original location or lost entirely (other than the copies others may have of that document)\n2. The ontologies may change but the version of the ontology isn't properly defined, so any document referring to it - may in-turn be contextualised in a way that is different to the intended meaning when the document referring to the ontology in reliance of that resource being contextually static - becomes disaffected.\n\nThere are also a few different classes of ontologies, some consider the records about a persons life to be a machine-readable ontology of that person; which is different to the ontologies used to structure the documents that create one or more of those records.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nIn-order to realise solutions for many of these goals, the systems need to be produced in-order to deliver the capacity to resolve the problems; but the practice of producing solutions to these sorts of problems still maintains exposure to various [[SocialAttackVectors]] without [[SafetyProtocols]] being operationally useful, as a consequence of the systems to achieve that not being made yet.  They often talk about 'chicken or egg' problems, noting that the answer to that problem is apparently - 'the rooster' - which i hope may illustrate the situation and related challenges.   Historically, i have personally maintained the IP rights in relation to my works; and at some stage, this needs to be transferred into an appropriate organisational structure, which in-turn requires a bunch of complex work and other resources to achieve in a fit-for-purpose manner.\n\n### Agency\n\nThe vast majority of ontologies use `OWL` which is technically defined to have a top-level term `thing`.  IMO: Human beings aren't things, they're people and primary custodians of anything and everything that happens in relation to our role as a species on earth. \n\nPart of the history is that the original components were closely linked with a darpa project that created an early version of the semantic web technologies, called DAML and then later daml+oil.  At that time (90's) most of the systems using these technologies were mainframes; as such the use-cases required were done in a different context to the circumstances of today.  Perhaps the idea that people would be defined by electronic systems, was not considered to be a reasonable problem at the time - as print-based records were still most common, in societies that acted differently during a time that did not have internet. \n\nSo, now these situations have changed; and it is important to figure out how to define ontological support for natural persons (human beings) and in particular ontological specificities around the nature of consciousness, personhood and human agency.  \n\nWhilst some of these considerations may reasonably live underneath a predicate of 'thing' other qualities - from a moral perspective - would seemingly not be done right that way.\n(although, that's seemingly how its all made to work now)\n\n### Privacy considerations\n\nThe use of Ai systems in many situations will increasingly be employed in personal, private, confidential and/or intimate settings, usecases and environments.  \n\nIn-order to achieve an ability to perform this functionality, the resources need to be locally available to the computing device that is processing the records and related systems. \n\nIn-turn part of the fundamental objective is to [[DecentralisedOntologies]] and other commons, providing a different way to manage electronic information to support human centric AI. \n\n## Technical Challenges\n\nDifferent DLTs / [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]] have different qualities.  These need to be mapped out.  Yet at least some of these solutions will have different cryptographic characteristics, which will impact the ability to produce trustworthy decentralised informatics (AI) assets.\n\nThe current belief; is that, part of the ontology document should refer to the different [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]] locations that the asset can be found on / via (ie: the UUID of the record); and this is unlikely to be best put into every document that makes use of any one of these URIs.  \n\n### Temporal Semantics\n\nIn-order to support [[PCTTemporalSemantics]] methods need to be defined to point to a specific document which may not be the current version of that document; although, there may be logic that provides an ability to present and/or illustrate both.  \n\nFor Example: legal documents, need to refer to laws relating to a legal document as were the case at the time.\n\n### Tamper Evidence / Cryptography\nThere is a desire to provide a cryptographic method to validate whether or not the document being obtained has been altered (hacked). \n\n### Permission Systems\nThere are different permission systems required for different usecases as such the methods to manage these permissions systems, need to be defined and then considered against the fuctionality of different systems.\n\nThe permission system requirements for different types of permissive commons assets are all different, depending on the usecases.  \n\n### Biosphere and Sociosphere relations\n\nIn what i've more broadly called '[[Currencies]]' (as that's the derivative outcome), the technical qualities of each method needs to be assessed and then some sort of logic system needs to be supported in-order to perform accounting like functionality; alongside systemic support for seeking to ensure commons artifacts are not lost forever - due to no-copies of the documents being stored anywhere accessible in any part of the network in future.\n\n### Version Conversions\n\nThere's a bunch of parsers that could be employed for various reasons.  One is to process a document that's designed for one type of network, in-order for it to be used on others. Another is to process a document or asset format to a new format (ie: .doc or .pdf to .md file).  \n\n### HyperMedia Containers\n\nThe concept of [[HyperMediaContainers]] is a bit like a docker container or similar, the record about hypermedia containers will go into it in more detail.  nonetheless the schema needs to be define.\n\n### Centricity of Relations\n\nIn what i call [[PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/EconomicSystems/Centricity]], the objective is to couple the legal relationships in the physical socio-economic and legal realms, with the format of how electronic systems are made to work 'online', whilst making some improvements (ie: human centric related ecosystems).  \n\nThis is in-turn intended to support jurisitictions and other factors that are clearly defined in various well known international instruments relating to human rights.\n\n### Decentralised Agents\n\nIt is important that the agents that are able to act as [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] processors are able to be run on almost any system - meaning - the ability to ensure they're able to be fully decentralised via some sort of fabric like method; rather than, supporting a means for any particular agent to seek to take control - which would act to invalidate freedom of thought.\n\n#### Transferability of stewardship and rights\n\nYet, the works are not necessarily going to be done by those parties and/or persons.  So whilst the moral stewardship of a particular permissive commons resource SHOULD be with a particular entity or group (ie: the UN Ontologies with the UN); that's not necessarily whose going to produce or make them available to begin with; In other circumstances, the duties for managing something may change to a different organisation or group, so this needs to be supported somehow.\n\nAnother clearer example; would be that the 'edit' permissions on legislation resides with the votes of the persons elected to the parliament who are responsible for enacting legislation. \n\nSomewhat obviously, the people involved in making decisions change from time-to-time (ie: elections)\n\n### Defining Human Ontologies\n\nThere is a need to define an array of ontologies that relate to humankind and in-turn related aspects such as consciousness and psychology / behavioural / sociological / belief system related ontological frameworks.   These must be fairly flexible and it is imperative that they're able to be managed with the upmost of consideration for privacy and moreover support for human dignity.   \n\n*Note:  there's various systems operating today that perform sentiment analysis, etc.  its likely that this is presently performed via the ontological context of `OWL:Thing`, yet regardless, these sorts of works are not about creating capabilities that are not already in existance from a perspective of whether or not these tools exist (ie: via CCTV systems in commercial settings, or when processing communications performed on social networks online); rather, the difference really is about ensuring the ontological definitions are about human beings having agency, rather than human beings being contextualised via AI related definitions that define people as assets and/or things of other entities (databases)*\n\n#### Right to Self Determination\n\nIn the documents about [[FreedomofThought]] and previously also; [[preserving-the-freedom-to-think]], the underlying considerations about the very seriously dangerous effects of poor AI systems design was initially provided some consideration, although moreover a prompt.\n\nWhen designing these systems, there's a balance between providing support for people who do not have technical skills, providing support and protections for people who are unwell; and ensuring that the way the technology is designed does not act to define them as an external agent; that is to say, that the designs must support the right to self-determination.\n\nor personal responsibility, as noted by Chomsky; as is otherwise illustrated in the document about [[SocialAttackVectors]].\n\n## Breaking it down.\n\nThe permissive commons ecosystem solutions have always been designed for the purpose of being deployed into a particular type of ecosystem, which hasn't been supported via the historical lens of a knowledge banking ecosystem, but has now led to the works on [[SocialFactors/CommercialModels/Webizen]].  \n\nRegardless of whether or not anyone uses the webizen systems; this work on permissive commons is intended to be about the production of technology for the public good, and thereby support the fundamental purpose of the [[Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject]].\n\nThere is a risk that i'll conflate or integrate aspects that should be related to webizen or those that should be related to Web Civics and therein, the broader [[Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject]] objectives.  \n\n## Financing - biosphere & socioeconomic relations\n\nI am presently unaware of how to properly finance this project; other than perhaps, via the use of the [[WorkProject]] related ecosystem solutions - which if improperly applied, might act against the fundamental purposes of this project.\n\n![[cooperativeProjects.jpg]]\nSource: [WebCivics / Cooperative Projects WIP UI](https://webcivics.github.io/CooperativeProjects/projects.html)\n\nAs with many of the modules of work, the concepts relating to these things are often quite old, with a background that goes back to sometime during the 00's (ie: 2000-10); and whilst the experience has led me to spend a lot more time focused on how to address [[SocialAttackVectors]] that i've learned about, leading to the desire to produce [[SafetyProtocols]] alongside the systems more broadly;  the application of how to do this work well, is been very hard.\n\n![[Answers_meme.jpg]]\n*Original Source/author unknown*\n\nIt has been common to see people get involved seeking to quickly 'know it all', in ways that have ended-up with substandard outcomes; particularly where it comes to human rights and related use-cases / constituents of specifications, that are more specifically support natural persons (ie: consumers ); which is now moreover denoted as [[Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject]] related works; although, instrumental / integral and considered to be unable to be delivered without producing [[SocialFactors/CommercialModels/Webizen]].\n\nOne possible method; is to charge enterprise users for the use of materials produced, via transactional payments; until such a time as the work-effort required to produce that work has been compensated - as a means to support [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] and support [[FairWorkProtocols]], whilst also enabling the use of these systems by human beings - freely (no-charge).\n\nAnother consideration also - is that nothing is free. \n\n![[timeisntfree.jpg]]\n\nNeither time nor energy is 'free' - both are resources that are consumed; and in too many situations, if a person is doing something good - its considered to be something that they should be punished for doing, by labelling that time / work / use of resources 'free'.\n\nLinked to this problem; is also the suggestion that the use of internet is 'free' without considering the energy part of the broader [[ESG]] equations. \n\nThe challenges becomes how to form a moral approach to addressing this problem, and in many ways - it leads me to want to think about doing it only for webizen so that the works don't get exploited and perverted by professional bad actors - of which there are many; and sadly also, many of them have become extremely succesful at it - in a toxic, competitive marketplace - so, its a very complex series of related issues...  But,\n\nPerhaps there could be an option baked into the systems that helps to address modalities about how systems are used?  or some other better method - which is something to be defined, and ideally not 'centrally' - the fundamental arbrar of circumstnaces involving wrong-doing is courts of law; this is the perscribed method to support [[TheValuesProject]] and its role with both the  [[Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject]] and [[Webizen]].  \n\nNonetheless, the systems are indeed intended to radically improve the means for evidence to be easily provided to a court of law for consideration via the perscribed method, as does relate broadly to human rights related instruments, etc.  \n\n##### Refactoring UBI?\n\nThere has been a widespread uprising of a concept called \"Universal Basic Income\" or UBI; which has thereafter sought to engender social-security related policies globally, and i've had various concerns about being employed to support digital slavery rather than [[EndingDigitalSlavery]], which in-turn gives rise to various problems relating to the ramifications upon tax (unpaid persons don't pay tax, even if they're provided UBI).  Yet perhaps this concept can be refactored to produce a solution that defines the [[MinimumWages]] for persons doing useful work, which might then be rationalised by cost-of-living or pricing power parity ecosystems; for the particular purpose, of seeking to ensure persons doing work for the betterment of humanity in a manner that has a usefully positive effect, are not required to invalidate their own humanity for having done so; as is seemingly the expectation of all to many (including governments) today.  So this might be termed 'universal minimum wages' or something? \n\nMore work needs to be done; and i'm unsure how this relates to the permissive commons ecosystems - yet; other than making a note of the importance of addressing these sorts of issues as is otherwise required for both the [[Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject]] and [[Webizen]] use-cases.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject/","title":"Peace Infrastructure Project"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Peace Infrastructure Project\n\nThe Peace Infrastructure Project is a far broader concept, that is about the purpose of these works and the intended application of the technology works produced via the webizen project, [[WebizenAlliance]] and in-turn also Web Civics & Trust Factory related concepts; to have the effect, of producing Knowledge Technology, or an uplift of 'Information Communications Technology' (ICT) in a particular way, as to support a radical uplift in capacity to use it to support Peace, and in-turn also, rapid advancement in our capacity to produce real-world Peace Infrastructure internationally.  \n\nRecently, i have been producing a library of materials that are presently only able to be somewhat easily collated via a [Google Drive Folder (see link)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tYFIggw8MIY5fD2u-nbwFRM6wqrhdmQZ) which in-turn provides some insights about the broad-ranging issues that threaten our ability to maintain and support improvements, in the interests of growing circumstances as does relate to the experiences of persons - to be experiencing life in a manner that is compatible with the concept of peace.\n\nThe implications of this type of consideration, is meaningful to many people in many different environments in many different ways.  \n\nFundamentally, the Webizen project has a higher-level objective to produce an ecosystem that can in-turn decentralise AI, support Human Rights, Address some serious issues; and thereby in-turn, provide a capacity to produce support for addressing the humanitarian issues of persons around the world, in a manner that cannot be achieved without it. The implications of how good technology can be used to help people, is so vast, i've found it very difficult to summarise.  As such, by Interacting with ChatAI i've asked it a few questions...\n\nIt seems to me, that those who seek to discourage people from making technology to support fairness, human rights, etc.  are better off arguing with a robot; which they can do, here's the link - ask it yourself [ChatAI](https://chat.openai.com/)\n\n\n### **Q:** What are the values universally shared by all of humanity worldwide?\n\n**OpenAI**:\n\nIt is difficult to identify values that are universally shared by all of humanity, as people from different cultures and backgrounds may hold different values and beliefs. However, there are some values that are widely considered to be important and are shared by many people across different cultures and societies. These may include:\n\n1. Respect for human rights and dignity: Many people around the world value the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, and believe that every person has certain fundamental rights that must be respected and protected.\n2. Fairness and justice: Many people value fairness and justice, and believe that everyone should be treated equally and with respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n3. Honesty and integrity: Many people value honesty and integrity, and believe that it is important to be truthful and transparent in one's actions and dealings with others.\n4. Compassion and empathy: Many people value compassion and empathy, and believe that it is important to show concern and care for others, and to be understanding and supportive of their needs and experiences.\n5. Responsibility and accountability: Many people value responsibility and accountability, and believe that individuals should be held accountable for their actions and should take responsibility for the consequences of their choices.\n\n### Q: Define Peace Infrastructure.\n\nPeace infrastructure refers to the systems, processes, and institutions that support peace in a society. This can include a variety of different things, such as:\n\n-   Legal frameworks and institutions that promote justice and rule of law\n-   Political systems and processes that encourage dialogue and compromise\n-   Economic systems that support equitable development and distribution of resources\n-   Educational systems that teach non-violent conflict resolution and respect for diversity\n-   Social support systems that provide assistance to vulnerable groups and promote social cohesion\n-   Media systems that report accurately and fairly on conflicts and promote peaceful dialogue\n\nOverall, peace infrastructure refers to the structures and practices that help to prevent and mitigate conflict, promote reconciliation and cooperation, and create a stable and secure environment for individuals and communities.\n\nhere are a few more examples of what can be included in peace infrastructure:\n\n-   Human rights protection: This can include laws and institutions that protect the rights of individuals and groups, as well as advocacy and education efforts to promote awareness and understanding of human rights.\n-   Security forces: These can include law enforcement agencies, military forces, and other security bodies that are responsible for maintaining order and protecting citizens from violence and crime.\n-   Mediation and conflict resolution: This can include processes and institutions that facilitate dialogue and negotiation between parties in conflict, such as mediation centers, peace negotiations, and truth and reconciliation commissions.\n-   Civil society organizations: These can include non-profit organizations, religious groups, and other community-based organizations that work to promote peace and address social issues.\n-   Community policing: This can refer to police programs that focus on building relationships with community members and working with them to address issues of crime and violence.\n\nOverall, building strong peace infrastructure is a complex and ongoing process that requires the involvement and cooperation of a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, civil society, and communities.\n\n\n### **Q:** How would you define the characteristics of human behaviour or an agent, needed to consider it peaceful as is distinct to wrongdoings, violence, negligence and other moral wrongs? \n\n**OpenAI**:\n\nThere are several characteristics that could be considered necessary for an agent (whether human or non-human) to be considered peaceful. These may include:\n\n- Refraining from causing harm to others: A peaceful agent is one that does not engage in activities that cause harm to others, such as physical violence, verbal abuse, or neglect.\n- Respecting the rights and autonomy of others: A peaceful agent is one that respects the rights and autonomy of others, and does not seek to control or dominate them.\n- Seeking peaceful resolution of conflicts: A peaceful agent is one that seeks to resolve conflicts through peaceful means, such as negotiation and mediation, rather than resorting to violence or aggression.\n- Showing empathy and compassion towards others: A peaceful agent is one that is empathetic and compassionate towards others, and seeks to understand and address their needs and concerns.\n- Actively promoting peace and harmony: A peaceful agent is one that actively promotes peace and harmony, and seeks to create conditions in which individuals and groups can coexist in a peaceful and harmonious manner.\n\n### Q: Describe Peace Infrastructure Technology... \n\nOpenAI: \nPeace infrastructure technology refers to the use of technology to support peacebuilding efforts and promote peaceful societies. This can include a variety of different things, such as:\n\n-   Communication technologies: These can include tools like social media platforms, messaging apps, and online forums that allow individuals and groups to connect, share information, and coordinate activities.\n    \n-   Data analysis and visualization tools: These can be used to analyze and present data on issues related to peace and conflict, such as patterns of violence, human rights abuses, and economic indicators.\n    \n-   Mapping and geospatial technologies: These can be used to create maps and visualizations of conflict-affected areas, helping to identify trends, hotspots, and patterns that may not be immediately apparent.\n    \n-   Monitoring and evaluation tools: These can be used to track progress and assess the effectiveness of peacebuilding interventions, such as peace negotiations, reconciliation programs, and economic development projects.\n    \n-   Virtual reality and simulation technologies: These can be used to create immersive training and education experiences that teach skills related to conflict resolution, negotiation, and other aspects of peacebuilding.\n    \n\nOverall, peace infrastructure technology can help to facilitate communication, cooperation, and coordination among peacebuilders, and can provide important tools and resources for understanding and addressing conflicts and promoting peaceful societies.\n\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PermissiveCommonsTech/","title":"Permissive Commons Tech"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Permissive Commons Tech\n\nPermissive Commons is thought of as a form of technology, given the requirement for a specification to be defined in-order for it to be made to work harmonously online.\n\n[[SemanticWeb]] Technologies are basically, part of the foundational technology components that are used for producing Artificial Intelligence systems.   When producing content that uses semantic web technologies such as linked-data (rdf), this provides an array of abilities, however the content being authored is not only the content provided by the individual themselves; in a linked-data document, the terms used are provided meaning via ontologies; such as a document discussing flora or fauna, or statistics or law or a particular circumstance; all of these sorts of written works (as an example) relies both upon the writings of the author and in-turn external resources, that are generally intended to be considered from a perspective of the present-tense; as relates, to when that document was authored. \n\nYet the way HTTP / WWW works currently, it is difficult to maintain the [[TemporalSemantics]] or semantic resolution / comprehension, as a consequence of how various websites update or change their content or at times, change their names and no-longer exist.  in other circumstances, the context of the time - is different to the context of a future time; so a link in a webpage describing something, may in-turn refer to an external source that later changes.\n\n### Permissive Commons Technology Outline\nPermissive Commons refers to the use of non-http-uris and protocols to support the management of 'commons' information in a manner that employs linked-data to structure consumable assets relating to a particular topic or subject; that supports the following features,\n\n1. The ability to decentralise the use of the information artifacts.\n2. The ability to independently assert read, append, write and delete permissions to different agents based on the context of the information category / type / stakeholder framework.\n3. The ability to support [[TemporalSemantics]] (inclusive to version control)\n4. The ability to make use of different types of protocols, depending on the needs of the producer of the permissive commons assets / content. \n5. The ability to make notations in RDF (linked data) that can point to a particular version of an artifact; and a protocol method that can support the discovery and use of that particular version, even if the original publisher no-longer makes that data available themselves (pending types / methods, etc.)\n6. The ability to support 'rules' about content management (read / append) in a way that is different to read permissions. \n7. The ability to support privacy (/ human dignity).\n\nLinked-Data Ontologies are often difficult to find online, all too often the original location of the namespace has moved or is no-longer available.  As semantic web systems are built using namespaces that are pointed at a particular location where the description of that ontology is intended to exist; when the links become broken, the consequences have a network effect.\n\nWeb 2.0 APIs provide information, whether it be permissioned or public; yet, this method requires users to make specified queries for the information they're looking for at the time of the query; which has an array of privacy implications in addition to the problems noted in relation to the linked-data ontology space issues.\n\nThe concept of 'commons' basically refers to some kind of 'group'.  It could refer to a group of people who live in a particular juristiction, whose governments publish their legislation in a permissive commons format; that provides others the ability to refer to the specific law that existed at a specific time in relation to a contract or other document relating to law is intended to be associated with; in this case, the general public have no ability to modify the records, but they are able to read / consume the records with their Local AI agent. \n\nAnother form of permissive commons may be an array of information about biosphere related things (ie: like wikipedia related assets) or machine learning models; or indeed also, works that relate to a group project, that leads to an ability to support different sorts of business models (note: [[ValueAccountingInitiatives]] ). \n\nThe concept of [[Ontologies]] is fairly important to understand; noting, one of the greatest purposes of Permissive Commons, is to support means to decentralise 'group' ontologies (is is distinct to personal ontologies). \n\nThe Development Folder for ontology related work is currently located [here on github](https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023) \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/","title":"Webizen"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"## What is Webizen?\n\n### Introduction\n\n[Webizen](https://github.com/linkeddata/webizen) 1.0 was a Search Engine. The project, alongside many other related projects were deprecated.  Some of the Resources were protected some time ago and now; redefined...\n\n![[webizen.jpg]]\n\n## The New Webizen\nWebizen is Independent to the project known as Solid (formerally [#rww](https://www.w3.org/community/rww/)) as run by [inrupt](https://www.inrupt.com). \n\nThe technology stack being produced as [Webizen 3.0](https://devdocs.webizen.org/WebizenTechStack/Webizen3.0/) requires the development of  [[PermissiveCommonsTech]]. \n\n(As is illustrated in the image / diagram below)\n\nThe 'Webizen Agent' requires both; a means to support the distribution, storage and use of information that is relied upon by more than one person (a 'commons') as well as a means to privately store and operate their own personal information.  \n\nA great deal of the underlying historical work related to and intended to employ derivatives that were produce via the #RWW & #CrossCloud related projects; which is in-turn what the name #Webizen is intended to pay tribute to, whilst likely to have a different sort of approach than has otherwise been demonstrated by #Solid.  \n\nFor more information see: [[WorkInProgress]]\n\n\n### What does Webizen Mean?\n\nWhen Asking #ChatGPT to define the Term Webizen; it says,\n\n>A webizen is a term used to describe an individual who is actively involved in online communities and who is an active and engaged citizen of the internet. Webizens are often thought of as being proactive and responsible users of the internet, who contribute to online communities in positive ways and help to create a sense of community and connection online.\n>\n>Webizens may be involved in a variety of online activities, such as participating in forums or discussion groups, creating content or media, or engaging with others on social media. They may also be involved in advocacy efforts related to internet governance or online rights and freedoms.\n>\n>Overall, the term webizen is used to describe individuals who are actively involved in online communities and who are committed to being responsible and engaged citizens of the internet.\n\nWhereas; when i consider the term 'Webizen', what i'm thinking about is future [Artificial Minds](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/WebScience/ArtificialMinds/) that are owned by human beings to be their assistant and support their needs. \n\nThe [[PCT-WebizenTechStack]] is in-effect, the creation of an ecosystem solution that provides support for [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI]] as is instrumental for [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] systems.\n\n### About Webizen Systems\nAs this documentation environment presents; The webizen systems, are designed in a particular way to support a particular type of ecosystem outcome that considers both a variety of technology related factors and requirements, in addition to various social factors and related considerations and implications. \n\n![[webizen_diagram_1-2.jpg]]\n\nThese systems become assembled to provide a different type of Computing Environment, which in-turn provide the opportunity to produce different types of Apps, that have different types of capabilities, functionality and features. \n\nThere are a series of principals relating to structure of these designs.  In-turn, the outcome is far greater than the sum of its parts...  In-effect, the environment provides a different sort of toolkit or apparatus, that is intended to support safety and the safe use of democratised [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI]].   The way this is emboided for social purposes, is that the environment produces an ecosystem solution to support a particular class of  that are in-turn what it is that the meaning of webizen is intended to define, in future. \n\n### The Future Webizen Agents\n\n![[WebizenPeaceBot.png]]\n\nThe Future Webizen Agents, are a type or class of Artificial Intelligent Agent that have a series of particular qualities; and importantly also, an array of [[SafetyProtocols]] that works effectively to ensure that other forms of Artificial Minds are not able to both be called or be made able to work on the [[PCT-WebizenTechStack]] and still be compliant with [[TheWebizenCharter]].\n\n### Digital Twins vs. Webizen\n\nFor a very long time, the work on forming a 'knowledge banking' (previously called an 'information bank' or 'ibank'); developed in a way where the advent of the term 'digital twin' was adopted in an effort to try to describe the role of an 'inforg' and in-turn the AI extension of a natural person, and the importance of seeking to ensure the ontological design and related social fabric issues were created in a way that could reasonably support Human Dignity.  But this method effectively failed.  The Strength of 'competition' from actors who sought to 'own' people digitally, via their 'digital twin' and related ecosystems, was so strong; and there was a complete lack of viable support for works to produce alternatives.  Further to these issues, when getting stuck into the fields of science of consciousness, the debates that were brought about were almost religious in nature.  Then, there were also technologists (many whom i admire) who were talking about AI being like a human; which, when bonded to the exhibits of how these technologies were being commercialised, led me to fear the implications.   So, these circumstances; which indeed also, i note the volume of remarkable minds who have provided support for me to be engendered with a basis to form insights,\n\nLed me to realise, that there was a pivotal shift that could or moreover should occur. \n\nWhat i needed to do, was to form a means to communicate and support the social development of works (on the [[SocialFactors]] ) by refocusing the work via a lens that was focused on seeking to get people to think about what sorts of  [Artificial Minds](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/WebScience/ArtificialMinds/) it is that they actually want to create.

However, the idea is that there will be notifications about whether or not another agent is running a particular type of safety protocol; as to alert others to their status or ideology, and thereby provide an ability for others they are communicating with, to decide how and/or if they want to communicate with that agent, by being able to take into account whether and/or what safety protcols they're operating.   \n\nSafety protocols may relate to providing insights as to whether or not an agent is who they claim themselves to be; or whether they've got particalar protocols taht are operated in-order to protect themselves and others from materials that are blatently criminal and/or relating to abuses of the human rights of others.  \n\nSafety protocols can be empoyed at different levels; some will be designed to operate at the systems level, others will be designed to operate in connection to the functionality of an app.\n\nSafety protocols will employ [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]] and [[PermissiveCommonsTech]], alongside other tooling as required to make an environment that is both able to be made highly secure, and simultaniously also - support safety both for the user and others they interact with, based upon the values they decide to be important for themselves, as individuals / groups.   \n\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SocioSphereOntologies/","title":"SocioSphere Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# SocioSphere Ontologies\n\nThe Concept of Sociosphere Ontologies is similar and interactive with [BiosphereOntologies](BiosphereOntologies.md), in that the social behaviours of what people do (or fail to do) or neglect, have impacts upon our sociology. \n\nPresently, many electronically interactive socio-economic systems prioritise the value of claims over whether or not they've been categorised appropriately or indeed also, if intimated to be 'facts', whether or not they're actually true.   \n\nThere are many interactive concepts and implications that delineate the relationships between activities and inferences; that is the causal relationships between natural agents, and observers; and these natural systems have [Relationships (Social|[../Temporal Semantics](../Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Relationships%20(Social)]].md)."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SustainableDevelopmentGoals(ESG)/","title":"Sustainable Development Goals (ESG)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Sustainable Development Goals (ESG)\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/VocabularyModelling/LanguageModels/Alphabets/ArabicAlphabet/","title":"ArabicAlphabet"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The **Arabic alphabet** ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language \"Arabic language\"): الْأَبْجَدِيَّة الْعَرَبِيَّة, __al-abjadīyah l-ʿarabīyah__ IPA: [[ʔælʔæbʒædijːæ-lʕɑrɑbijːæ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Arabic \"Help:IPA/Arabic\") or الْحُرُوف الْعَرَبِيَّة, __al-ḥurūf l-ʿarabīyah__), or **Arabic [abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad \"Abjad\")**, is the [Arabic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script \"Arabic script\") as it is codified for writing [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic \"Arabic\").

In-turn the point of this index, is to provide the underlying references required to inform how [[SafetyProtocols]] and other ecosystem requirements need to address those sorts of problems, in a manner that supports the goals of; and as is related to, the [[Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject]].\n\n**Topics include; but are not limited to,** \nTorts, Dishonesty, Usury, Exploitation, Abuse, Malfesence, Social Harms, Deceptive & Misleading Behaviours, Wrongs, Financial Crimes, Corproate Crimes, Attacks Online, Fraud, Social Engineering, etc.\n\n*IMHO: At the end of the day, harms caused to [[BiosphereOntologies]] entities, is fundamentally caused by other [[BiosphereOntologies]] entities, regardless of the [[SocioSphereOntologies]] related implications.*  \n\n*There are various forms of Social Attack Vectors, Actions and Activities; that have existed for a very long time, and others that have become a problem in recent decades due to the implications of the use of technology, as does in-turn relate to designs.* \n\nSo far, i have been able to produce some materials that cover the following sub-topics,\n\n- [[CommercialExploitation]]\n- [[AttacksOnline]]\n- [[CriminalActivity]]\n- [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]]\n- [[Dishonesty]] including but not limited to; [[FakeNews]]\n- [[Dehumanisation]]\n- [[TemporalAttacks]]\n- [[Torts]]\n\nThere is an enormous amount of work to be done in relation to this area, and it will take some time.  I also find it to be emotionally exhausting (as noted below); in the meantime, here are some of my thoughts on considerations related to this area of work that is importantly done, to an appropriate level, as to thereafter ensure solutions are illustratively equipped to demonstrate how the ecosystems are intended to work to put a stop to it and/or provide vastly improved means for accessibility to lawful remedy for disaffected persons.  \n\n#### Introduction: Purpose\n\n\n![[codeofchivalry.jpg]]\n\n\n[[TheValuesProject]] seeks to employ various methods, including [[WhatIsWebScience]] and other [[SocialFactors]] related considerations to structure methodologies to enable means for people to be better equipped to both benefit from the support of [[SafetyProtocols]] and related considerations; a difficult, yet important documentation requirment is to make note of various types of 'social attack vectors', whether they're intended to be addressed via [[Trust Factory]] related methodologies or more broadly otherwise (ie; web civics, etc.) its still important that they're able to be considered somehow. \n\n> *Personally, i stuggle doing these sorts of tasks and find it very difficult to have a level of comfort about the idea that i've illustrated the problems well enough, or that it is a safe thing to undertake to do; there is both great sadness and an enormous amount of life invested into seeking to be positively responsive towards addressing problems relating to the human rights of others; and in most cases, it can't really be fully discussed publically. Yet what can be done, is that the underlying principals can be illustrated as a means to support design considerations that denote a level of responsibility that has been so clearly absent from the work done by others.  It is all well and good to solely care about 'yourself' selfishly, and not address the means to address problems - but this is neither appropriate nor responsible, nor consistant with the actual fundamental relationship between leadership and the responsibilities that are inextricably linked to the appropriate use of that term as to strive towards living in a manner that is consistant with, what may be considered a fundamental belief in the existance of universal moral values; as is something that has been referred to for consideration by [Professor Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky)... *\n> \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJ2vr2YnSGA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n>*As i have noted elsewhere, on the 3rd of April 2018 in response to corraspondance with Professor Chomsky, as i worked to pursue the development of the ontology related works required to support [[FreedomofThought]] and related requirements.  The percieved problem was that whilst many of the [W3C CG](W3.org/community/) related folk (including those more broadly whom are involved in such things as [[WhatIsWebScience]]); there was a percieved problem about the lack of social comprehensions in relation to ontological designs; as can in-turn have the effect of perverting the ability for societies to support 'common sense' and persons to have a meaningul relationship with reality. *\n\n> *Professor Chomsky noted simply;*\n\n\"The fact that there are pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility.  The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself.\"\n\n> *Yet, as has been demonstrated more significantly in recent years; there are complex underlying factors, that i have sought to address which has the effect of feeding into the [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] designs, alongside the broader ecosystems required to support it; as, the fundamental problem becomes, that where people become disassociated as a consequence of the intended behaviours of others, then the problem becomes linked with the importance of the concept to ensure we're working on [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].*\n\n> *[[UnderstandingOntologies]] is of critical importance to gain a better comprehension about the implications and in-turn how they have a foundational basis in built upon science; that can and is in-turn exploited by bad actors (often highly sophistocated ones); as is one of the many forms of Social Attack Vectors that are becoming a greater problem due to AI infrastructure, that is not operating appropriate [[SafetyProtocols]] - or at least, that's my opinion.  Whilst others may be satisfied and/or happy with the way their ICT systems work for them; the designs brought about via the [[PCT-WebizenTechStack]] and related applied methods to address [[SocialFactors]] via [[WhatIsWebScience]] and otherwise; in-turn leads to complex factors that fundamentally relate to human consciousness.   An example of the implications has sought to be illustrated by  [Henry Strapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stapp) in the simpliest way i've ever seen done, per below. *\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYPjXz1MVv0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n> *These sorts of considerations in-turn feed into the ecosystems design paradigms that are embedded into the body of works and the method of assembly relating to the ecosystems tooling, etc.*\n\n> *When considering the intended purpose of constituencies such as [[TheWebizenCharter]], the [[CommunityOfPractice]] and other [[WebizenAlliance]] [[Commercial Models]] that as stated - seek to support the growth of the far broader [[Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/PeaceInfrastructureProject]] , Old concepts, whether they be embedded in the systems of faith that people have in all parts of the world; or via old codes of conduct as noted earlier; and indeed also, old terms such as The term Worshipful;*\n  \n  *(a) Honorable, virtuous, of noble character, estimable; highly respectable, decent; of a knight: excelling in knightly virtues, courageous, courteous, of great prowess; maken ~, to honor (sb.); \n (b) deserving of honor or respect, praiseworthy; also, ?deserving of special treatment, singular [quot. a1500(c1477)]; \n (c) of an act, a ceremony: demonstrative of due honor or respect; \n (d) renowned, eminent, famed; \n (e) bringing honor or distinction; \n (f) as noun: one who is honorable, a respectable person. \n  Source: [Middle English Compendium](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/middle-english-dictionary/dictionary/MED53455) \n\n> *Which does in-turn relate to the term [The Honourable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable) as is more commonly used today.  The underlying point being that unless there are lawful means to address wrongs that are committed upon people with the express intent of causing that person injury; or indeed also, behaviours that unwittingly or mistakenly caused a person injury; unless there are lawful means to seek remedy, then there is no available means to support Peace.*  \n\n> *As such, i find myself now having to go through the difficult process of describing the nature of some of the horrible things people seemingly seek to gainfully do; involving harms to others. Many of these sorts of issues have existed for a very long time, whilst others have only become a problem or a worse problem due to newer issues.  \n\nIt is thought that the reason why many of these issues haven't been better addressed is in-part due to the sophistocated nature of what needs to occur to bring about a more comprehensive 'ecosystems solution' to address bad behaviour / bad actors.  There are various 'classes' of bad actors which are not the same as one-another.  Often they're interactive and often it is unclear which 'category' or 'agent' is best associated with which category.  \n\nDue to various forms of vulnerability and the lack of functionality provided to support [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]] - that is, the ability to support a means where people self-declare what their values frameworks are; and both, what should be expected of them and in-turn also, the relationship.\n\nSo, this document and the related group of additional documents on related topics; seeks to illustrate various types of 'attack vectors' and in-turn support the means to consider how it is this environment appropriates a mechanism to provide better 'moral security' and/or alerts and accountability measures that are intended to act in-turn to better support healthy (safe) [[Relationships(Social)]], etc.\n\n#### Description of different types of attacks\n\nWhilst work to more appropriately illustrate the somewhat exhaustive nature of how various types of attack vectors are all too often gainfully employed by bad people and those who've been misled by bad people; none of it is simple, and people who have developed to become professionals in the field employ extremely well-developed and complex methodologies to achieve their objectives - which are generally for personally gainful purposes, at the material expense of others, that may well have consequences relating to serious injury, impairment, disability and/or death of their targets.  These sorts of attacks are not simple, and can often evolve in a manner that leads to many different actors getting involved in a broader 'agenda' that serves the interest (at least initially) of the would-be beneficiary.  \n\nThe consequences are often defined by law to constitute an emboidment of actions and/or behaviours that may be thereby considered an alledged crime; and whilst the proper venue to sort these sorts of things out is a court of law, the apparatus to ensure that avenue for lawful remedy be available, is often actively discouraged by an array of parties; not simply those well known to be involved in crime and/or organised crime.  \n\n\n### ChatGPT Contributions\n\nGiven one of the prominently employed social attack vectors is to seek to debase the merit of a persons words and/or ability to be heard or be socially supported to be listened to; the use of ChatGPT has been used fairly extensively; including contributions for this topic also\n\n\nBelow is some content that has been generated by ChatGPT.   \n\nThere are a number of social attack vectors or behaviors that can negatively impact knowledge workers who are working online. Some examples include:\n\n1.  Character assassination: Attacking someone's character online, often through spreading false or malicious information about them, can damage their reputation and credibility, and can make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n2.  Gaslighting: Manipulating someone into doubting their own perceptions or memories, often through the use of manipulation and deception, can undermine their confidence and make it more difficult for them to speak up or advocate for themselves.\n    \n3.  Bullying: Using aggressive or abusive behavior to intimidate or dominate others can create a toxic work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n4.  Exclusion: Excluding someone from important conversations or decisions, or versioning them out of documentation that they were involved in creating, can undermine their contributions and make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Harassment, including sexual harassment, can create a hostile work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n6.  Discrimination: Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic can create an unfair and hostile work environment, and can make it more difficult for people to succeed in their careers.\n\nIt is important to recognise that these social attack vectors can have serious negative impacts on knowledge workers, and can make it more difficult for them to do their jobs effectively. They can also create a toxic work environment that is harmful to the well-being of workers.\n\nTo protect against these types of social attacks, it is important to have clear policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse, and to have processes in place for addressing and resolving conflicts. It is also important to create a culture of respect and inclusion, and to encourage open and honest communication. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive work environment for knowledge workers.\n\nIf a target of social attacks is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to law enforcement, legal and/or court processes, or due to threats or fears for their safety, it is important for their employer or organization to have policies and practices in place to protect them. This may involve providing them with additional support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n\nIt may also be necessary to take steps to protect the privacy of the individual and any other persons who may be involved in the situation. This may involve limiting the dissemination of information about the situation and taking steps to ensure that any information that is shared is done so in a way that is consistent with relevant privacy laws and regulations.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation and protect the safety of the individual and any other persons who may be involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a well-defined process in place for addressing and resolving situations where an individual is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to legal or safety considerations, and to provide the necessary support and resources to ensure that the individual is protected.\n\nIf law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals involved in a situation, it may be necessary to explore other options for addressing the issue. This could involve seeking assistance from other authorities or organizations, such as human rights organizations or NGOs, that may be able to provide additional support and resources.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to pursue legal action to hold law enforcement or other authorities accountable for their failure to protect the safety of the individuals involved. This could involve filing a complaint or lawsuit seeking damages or other remedies.\n\nIt is also important to consider the safety and well-being of the individuals involved and to take steps to protect them, even if law enforcement is not able to provide the necessary protection. This may involve seeking assistance from friends, family, or other trusted sources, or seeking shelter or other forms of support to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a plan in place for addressing situations where law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals, and to have the necessary resources and support available to ensure the safety and well-being of those involved.\n\nIf a person being attacked has reported the matter to law enforcement but the situation has not yet been resolved and they are subsequently attacked online publicly and/or socially, it is important for those managing online community environments to take steps to protect their human rights. This may involve:\n\n1.  Providing support and resources: It is important to provide the person with any necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n    \n2.  Ensuring their safety: It is important to take steps to ensure the safety of the person being attacked, such as by providing them with access to shelter or other forms of support.\n    \n3.  Protecting their privacy: It is important to respect the privacy of the person being attack and to take steps to protect their personal information, especially if they are unable to publish all of the evidence relating to the matter online due to legal or safety considerations.\n    \n4.  Providing a safe and inclusive environment: It is important to create a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the online community, and to have policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse.\n    \n5.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to encourage open and honest communication and to create a culture of respect and inclusion, where people feel safe and supported in sharing their experiences and concerns.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals who are being attack online and to create a more positive and supportive online community environment.\n\nIt is important to note that in order to effectively protect the human rights of individuals who are being attacked online, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities, depending on the nature of the attack and the risks to the individual's safety. It may also be necessary to seek assistance from other organizations or individuals who have expertise in addressing online attacks and can provide additional support and resources.\n\nIt is also important to be aware of relevant laws and regulations that may apply in situations where individuals are being attack online, and to take steps to ensure that the rights of the individuals involved are being protected.\n\nOverall, it is important to take a proactive approach to addressing online attacks and to have the necessary policies and resources in place to protect the human rights of those involved. This may involve providing support and resources to individuals who are being attack, creating a safe and inclusive online community environment, and working with law enforcement and other authorities to address the situation.\n\n### Commercially Motivated Attacks\nIf the underlying purpose of an attack is commercial or related to financial crimes, and the primary purpose is to obtain an advantage and/or harm the victim in a way that will prevent them from being compensated for their work and cause them injury, it is important for communities involved in work-related activities online to take steps to protect human rights and prevent harm to individuals. This may involve:\n\n1.  Having policies in place to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse: It is important to have policies in place that clearly define what types of behavior are not acceptable and provide guidance on how to report and address incidents of financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n2.  Providing support and resources to victims: It is important to provide victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse with the necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n    \n3.  Working with law enforcement and other authorities: It may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.\n    \n4.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to create a culture of transparency and encourage open and honest communication within the community, as this can help to identify and address issues related to financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes.\n\nIn addition to the steps I listed earlier, there are a few other things that communities involved in work-related activities online can do to protect human rights and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes:\n\n1.  Educate members of the community: It is important to educate members of the community about financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to provide them with information about how to recognize and report these types of incidents.\n    \n2.  Promote ethical behavior: It is important to promote ethical behavior and to encourage community members to act with integrity and respect for the rights of others. This may involve establishing codes of conduct or ethical guidelines for community members to follow.\n    \n3.  Foster a culture of inclusivity and respect: It is important to create a culture of inclusivity and respect within the community, and to encourage open and respectful dialogue and debate. This can help to create a more positive and supportive environment and reduce the risk of harm to individuals.\n    \n4.  Monitor and address issues as they arise: It is important to regularly monitor the community for signs of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and to take prompt action to address any issues that are identified.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, communities can create a more positive and supportive environment for all members, and can help to protect the human rights of individuals who may be at risk of abuse.\n\nIf a case or circumstance like this cannot be openly discussed publicly due to privacy, legal, or safety reasons, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to those involved. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individuals involved.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of those involved. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy, legal, and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nIf a person is excluded, socially assaulted, and subjected to other broader social, mental, and economic harms as a result of an attack, and the circumstances of the attack cannot be discussed publicly due to privacy and safety issues, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to the person who has been harmed. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of social, mental, and economic abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of the person who has been harmed. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individual.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nThere are a number of compensation and other measures that could be considered in order to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit people who do the right thing and act in accordance with and support of human rights instruments. Some options may include:\n\n1.  Financial compensation: In cases where individuals have suffered financial harm as a result of being subjected to social attack vectors, it may be appropriate to provide financial compensation to help them recover from their losses.\n    \n2.  Legal remedies: In cases where the actions of others have violated the rights of individuals, it may be appropriate to seek legal remedies, such as damages or injunctions, to hold those responsible accountable for their actions and to provide compensation to the individuals who have been harmed.\n    \n3.  Counseling and support services: It may be necessary to provide counseling and other support services to individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors in order to help them cope with the emotional and mental trauma they may have experienced.\n    \n4.  Education and training: Providing education and training on human rights and ethical conduct can help to promote a culture of respect and inclusion, and can encourage individuals to act in accordance with these principles.\n    \n5.  Policies and procedures: Having clear policies and procedures in place to address social attack vectors and other forms of abuse can help to prevent harm to individuals and create a more positive and supportive community environment.\n    \n\nBy considering these and other measures, it is possible to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit those who do the right thing and act in support of human rights, rather than benefiting those who engage in social attack vectors for financial or social gain.\n\nIt is also important to have mechanisms in place for addressing and resolving conflicts that may arise within a community of practice, and for holding individuals accountable for their actions. This may involve having processes in place for reporting and investigating incidents of abuse or misconduct, and for taking disciplinary action as appropriate.\n\nIt may also be helpful to have resources available for individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors or other forms of abuse, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n\nOverall, it is important to create a culture of respect and inclusion within a community of practice, and to have policies and procedures in place to address and prevent social attack vectors and other forms of abuse. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive environment for all members of the community and to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected and protected.\n\nA semantic web ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts and relationships within a specific domain of knowledge, using a standardized vocabulary and logical rules. In the context of managing social attack vectors, an ontology could be used to represent concepts such as:\n\n-   Social attack vector: A specific type of behavior or tactic that is used to harm or exploit others, either individually or as part of a group.\n    \n-   Human rights: The fundamental rights and freedoms that are inherent to all human beings, and which are protected under

From the student's point of view, it is a dictionary of more than 13,000 word senses, most of them with annotated examples that show the meaning and usage. For the researcher in Natural Language Processing, the more than 200,000 manually annotated sentences linked to more than 1,200 semantic frames provide a unique training dataset for semantic role labeling, used in applications such as information extraction, machine translation, event recognition, sentiment analysis, etc. For students and teachers of linguistics it serves as a valence dictionary, with uniquely detailed evidence for the combinatorial properties of a core set of the English vocabulary. The project has been in operation at the [International Computer Science Institute](http://icsi.berkeley.edu/) in Berkeley since 1997, supported primarily by the National Science Foundation, and the data is freely available for download. It has been downloaded and used by researchers around the world for a wide variety of purposes (see [FrameNet downloaders](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/framenet_users)). FrameNet-like databases have been built for a number of languages (see [FrameNets in other languages](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/framenets_in_other_languages)) and a new project is working on aligning the FrameNets across languages.\n\n## Framenet Glossary\n\nannotation  \nThe assignment of semantic role tags to syntactic constituents.\n\nAnnotation database  \nThe part of the FrameNet database that holds the annotated sentences.\n\ncomplement (comp)  \nA grammatical function used for various oblique constituents, e.g. the prepositional phrase in The robbers tied his feet together with a black cord.\n\nconstructional null instantiation (CNI)  \nAn FE that is missing because the grammar of the sentence allows or requires an omission (e.g. the subject of an imperative, the agent of a passive verb).\n\ncore  \nFrame elements that are essential to the meaning of a frame are called \"core\" FEs (e.g Speaker in frames connected with communication);

Citation figures are critical to WordNet funding.\n\n### About WordNet\n\nWordNet® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the [browser](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn). WordNet is also freely and publicly available for [download](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/node/5). WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.\n\nWordNet superficially resembles a thesaurus, in that it groups words together based on their meanings. However, there are some important distinctions. First, WordNet interlinks not just word forms—strings of letters—but specific senses of words. As a result, words that are found in close proximity to one another in the network are semantically disambiguated. Second, WordNet labels the semantic relations among words, whereas the groupings of words in a thesaurus does not follow any explicit pattern other than meaning similarity.\n\n### Structure\n\nThe main relation among words in WordNet is synonymy, as between the words shut and close or car and automobile. Synonyms--words that denote the same concept and are interchangeable in many contexts--are grouped into unordered sets (synsets). Each of WordNet’s 117 000 synsets is linked to other synsets by means of a small number of “conceptual relations.” Additionally, a synset contains a brief definition (“gloss”) and, in most cases, one or more short sentences illustrating the use of the synset members. Word forms with several distinct meanings are represented in as many distinct synsets. Thus, each form-meaning pair in WordNet is unique.\n\n### Relations\n\nThe most frequently encoded relation among synsets is the super-subordinate relation (also called hyperonymy, hyponymy or ISA relation). It links more general synsets like {furniture, piece_of_furniture} to increasingly specific ones like {bed} and {bunkbed}. Thus, WordNet states that the category furniture includes bed, which in turn includes bunkbed; conversely, concepts like bed and bunkbed make up the category furniture. All noun hierarchies ultimately go up the root node {entity}. Hyponymy relation is transitive: if an armchair is a kind of chair, and if a chair is a kind of furniture, then an armchair is a kind of furniture. WordNet distinguishes among Types (common nouns) and Instances (specific persons, countries and geographic entities). Thus, armchair is a type of chair, Barack Obama is an instance of a president. Instances are always leaf (terminal) nodes in their hierarchies.\n\nMeronymy, the part-whole relation holds between synsets like {chair} and {back, backrest}, {seat} and {leg}. Parts are inherited from their superordinates: if a chair has legs, then an armchair has legs as well. Parts are not inherited “upward” as they may be characteristic only of specific kinds of things rather than the class as a whole: chairs and kinds of chairs have legs, but not all kinds of furniture have legs.\n\nVerb synsets are arranged into hierarchies as well; verbs towards the bottom of the trees (troponyms) express increasingly specific manners characterizing an event, as in {communicate}-{talk}-{whisper}. The specific manner expressed depends on the semantic field; volume (as in the example above) is just one dimension along which verbs can be elaborated. Others are speed (move-jog-run) or intensity of emotion (like-love-idolize). Verbs describing events that necessarily and unidirectionally entail one another are linked: {buy}-{pay}, {succeed}-{try}, {show}-{see}, etc.\n\nAdjectives are organized in terms of antonymy. Pairs of “direct” antonyms like wet-dry and young-old reflect the strong semantic contract of their members. Each of these polar adjectives in turn is linked to a number of “semantically similar” ones: dry is linked to parched, arid, dessicated and bone-dry and wet to soggy, waterlogged, etc. Semantically similar adjectives are “indirect antonyms” of the contral member of the opposite pole. Relational adjectives (\"pertainyms\") point to the nouns they are derived from (criminal-crime).   \nThere are only few adverbs in WordNet (hardly, mostly, really, etc.) as the majority of English adverbs are straightforwardly derived from adjectives via morphological affixation (surprisingly, strangely, etc.)\n\n### Cross-POS relations\n\nThe majority of the WordNet’s relations connect words from the same part of speech (POS). Thus, WordNet really consists of four sub-nets, one each for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, with few cross-POS pointers. Cross-POS relations include the “morphosemantic” links that hold among semantically similar words sharing a stem with the same meaning: observe (verb), observant (adjective) observation, observatory (nouns). In many of the noun-verb pairs the semantic role of the noun with respect to the verb has been specified: {sleeper, sleeping_car} is the LOCATION for {sleep} and {painter}is the AGENT of {paint}, while {painting, picture} is its RESULT."},{"fields":{"slug":"/VocabularyModelling/LanguageModels/LargeLanguageModels/cyc/","title":"Cyc"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nWikiPedia Description: \n\n**Cyc** (pronounced [/ˈsaɪk/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\") [_SYKE_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key \"Help:Pronunciation respelling key\")) is a long-term [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\") project that aims to assemble a comprehensive [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science) \"Ontology (information science)\") and [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base \"Knowledge base\") that spans the basic concepts and rules about how the world works.

Network tariffs can be based on a variety of factors, including the amount of data or bandwidth used, the length of time the network or service is accessed, or the type of service or application being used.*\n\n*Network tariffs are commonly used by telecommunications companies to charge customers for the use of their mobile phone or internet services. They can also be used by other types of businesses or organizations, such as utilities or transportation companies, to charge customers for the use of their networks or services. Network tariffs are typically structured as a flat fee or as a pay-per-use model, depending on the specific needs of the business or organization.*\n\nNOTE: the considerations about Network Tarrif associates in-turn also to [[Non-FinancialCurrencies]] and in-particular, working on solutions to address biosphere economics issues.\n\n### CONSIDERATIONS\nMany of these sorts of payments will apply in different ways and different circumstances, as to create various types of financial models for various purposes that will often become linked together via [[Ontologies]] for generating different kinds of functionally useful insights and documents.  \n\nTherein; the ability for a person to perform work activities, whether it be in the form of [[KnowledgeWork]] or [[LabourWork]] requires a person to make an array of payments for things like utilities, rent or mortgages, etc.   This may in-turn be used privately by that person to undertake cost/benefit analysis and other financial management processes; without necessarily sharing that information with others in any way that may be deemed unnecessary.\n\nEqually, depending on the context - some of this information is extremely helpful; for example, for the purpose of seeking a loan or similar where a persons financial position needs to be communicated to the organisation that may in-turn be prepared to offer that loan.  \n\nSimilarly, yet different; in the case of disputes and any circumstances that may in-turn cause a person to suffer losses and/or become unable to service any existing loans; then this information becomes useful to evaluate the costs associated with any dispute and/or insurance related event.\n\nOther forms of payments are critical components that require the appropriate supporting infrastructure, in-order to facilitate those sorts of payment systems with Webizen solutions.\n\nThis is likely to require some sort of payment processing facilitator and support for whatever requirements they may have in-order to provide those services in connection to the use of payments in association with the [[WorkProject]] and/or other applications and related Economic functionality.   \n\nSome investigation needs to be undertaken to comprehend the requirements for supporting economic systems that support micropayments to in-turn compensate [[KnowledgeWork]] and act to [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] as is in-effect part of the broader [[FairWorkProtocols]]. \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/EconomicSystems/Currencies/Micropayments/","title":"Micropayments"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Micropayment systems are a critical component of how the requirements for various systems, are going to be made able to work.

Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWenger1998)).\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)).\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunchroom at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFDub%C3%A9BourhisJacob2005)) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFSheridan2015)). A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFKietzmannPlanggerEatonHeilgenberg2013)) is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [American pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pragmatism \"American pragmatism\"), especially [C. S. Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Peirce \"C. S. Peirce\")'s concept of the \"[community of inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_inquiry \"Community of inquiry\")\" ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFShields2003)), but also [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey \"John Dewey\")'s principle of learning through occupation ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWallace2007)).\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/EconomicSystems/WebizenAlliance/TheWebizenCharter/","title":"The Webizen Charter"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# The Webizen Charter\n\nThe Webizen Charter is the web-civics version of the 3 laws of robotics or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\nIts yet to be formally defined, yet basically, its about promoting good (even if not understood at the time) whilst discouraging / punishing bad behaviours.  The structure of it, seeks to support the semantics of what people involved 'believe' rather than being dictatorial; and, It seeks to support rule of law.  \n\nThere are also philophical elements, yet these constituencies are often emboided in some form via existing [ValuesCredentials](WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials.md). As such, it forms a fabric to support both; network wide scale terms, in addition to personal terms; that relate more specifically to the user and/or their dependants (ie: their kids, or elderly persons for whom they are lawfully responsible to make just decisions for).\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence related terms; also consider the following aspects,\n\n1. That only Human Beings can be sent to prison.  As such the 'human centric' nature of the constructs, seek to support 'root cause analysis' and the provision of appropriately defined electronic evidence for persons, irraspective of their financial capacity or mental state; to seek lawful remedy via a court of law through the use of evidence as is collected about their lives.\n\n\ta. It is not upto a 'computer' to determine finally a 'just outcome' rather, the facility is provided socially via courts of law.  Systems are produced to support the requirements of courts of law.\n\t\n\tb. That the right to self-determination (as is required and a requirement for [FreedomofThought](FreedomofThought.md) ) depends upon an ability for persons to have some sense of situation awareness that is provided to them - on a basis that may reasonably be considered [BestEfforts](BestEfforts.md) as to distinguish a circumstance where a person engaged in behaviour that was an intentional or willful breach, vs. other circumstances that should influence the determinations of fault & other 'common' responsibilities.\n\t\n\tc. That the environment expressly supports the means for persons to both learn about; and support / agree / take-on the personal responsibility, to uphold particular values.  If somone engages with another who has not taken-on those values, then to some-degree they do so knowingly. \n\t\n2. The Entity Centric approaches consider the role of legal entities (legal personalities / incorporated groups) as is distinct yet inclusive with, natural persons (human beings / citizens / etc).  In this 'legal entity' group inclusive process, built upon the human centric capacities (1) there is still responsibility for what individual people do; either directly, or via an agent (ie: software, etc); but it takes into account 'ethics' vs. 'morals' in which, \n   \n   a. an individual may express (and have recorded) their personal view, which defines a moral factor in relation to their own being; yet,\n\t\n\tb. a group (ie: board of directors) may vote, and the most amount of votes upon a decision is what ends-up becoming the outcome; which becomes an ethical statement of the group.\n\t\n\tAn ethical decision made by a group (corpus) may be found to be wrong; but then still, the responsibility lies upon those who voted for whatever it was that supported wrongs, rather than those who voted against it. \n\n\tThis in-turn; supports the semantics between a person (natural person) and a legal entity (legal person); and their actions, as to distinguish who it is, that should end-up facing a court of law with the evidence provided via technology, to answer for the consequence of their actions; if a matter ends-up developing into a situation where that is deemed necessary by a party.\n\n3.

The Response was as follows,\n\nCarbon credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to offset carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon credits are used as a way to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and to promote the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\nUnder a carbon credit system, a government or other authority sets a cap on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted within a specific region or sector. Companies or other organizations that exceed their allocated carbon emissions are required to purchase carbon credits from those that have emitted less than their allocated amount. This creates a market for carbon credits, with the goal of reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions and incentivizing the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\nCarbon credits can be bought and sold on carbon markets, such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) or the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). The value of carbon credits is typically based on the cost of reducing or offsetting a ton of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nOverall, carbon credits are a way to use market forces to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\n\n\n>Then, i asked,\n> Q: What are some other non-financial biosphere related currencies?\n\nThere are many types of non-financial currencies that are related to the biosphere or the natural environment.

Fungible goods or assets are interchangeable, meaning that they can be used to satisfy a debt or obligation regardless of their specific characteristics or qualities.\n\n*For example, money is a fungible asset because it can be exchanged for any other good or service of equal value. Gold is also a fungible asset because it can be traded for other gold or for other goods or services of equal value. In contrast, non-fungible goods or assets are unique and cannot be exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value. For example, a work of art or a collectible item is non-fungible because it has a unique value that cannot be replicated or replaced.*\n\n*Another term for fungibility is exchangeability. When a good or asset is exchangeable, it means that it can be traded or exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value. Exchangeability is closely related to the concept of fungibility, and the two terms are often used interchangeably to refer to the property of goods or assets that can be traded or exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value.*\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/EconomicSystems/WorkProject/ContributionClassifications/","title":"Contribution Classifications"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Contribution Classifications\n\nQuickly produced using ChatGPT Q&A\n\nQ: When doing online knowledge work on a project, it is important to encourage others to get involved and participate.

I am looking to define a Contribution Classification system that can categorise different types of contributions so that the distinctions can be better made understandable to other people, and in-turn provide a means to create different types of contractual obligations about the use of those persons work. What Contribution Classifications do you think are important to define?\n\n>A: There are several potential contribution classifications that might be important to define when creating a system for categorizing different types of contributions in the context of online knowledge work. Some potential classifications to consider might include:\n\n>1.  Necessary contributions: These are contributions that are identified as necessary for the successful completion of a project. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are specifically assigned to individuals or that are essential for the project to move forward.\n    \n> 2.  Unsolicited contributions: These are contributions that are made by individuals without being specifically requested or assigned.

It is typically non-routine and requires a high level of education, training, or experience. Examples of knowledge work include research, consulting, analysis, design, and development. This type of work is often associated with information-intensive industries such as finance, technology, and education. It is typically done by professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, and scientists, and requires the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and make informed decisions.\n\nThe creation of software for the support of socio-economic ecosystems that act to preserve human rights, support the needs of workers, and protect against exploitation and other harms can be considered a form of knowledge work. This type of software development involves the use of specialized knowledge and expertise to design, develop, and maintain software systems that support these important social and economic goals.\n\nSoftware developers engaged in this type of work may be involved in the creation of systems that help to monitor and protect the rights of workers, such as by tracking working hours and ensuring fair pay. They may also work on software that helps to prevent exploitation and other forms of abuse, such as by providing tools for reporting and tracking incidents.\n\nIn addition to technical skills, knowledge work in this context may also require a deep understanding of social and economic issues, as well as a commitment to promoting and upholding human rights. The development of software to support socio-economic ecosystems requires a high level of creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking in order to create effective and sustainable solutions to complex challenges.\n\nPhilosophy, web science, and economics can all play important roles in the production of software designed to support knowledge workers.\n\nPhilosophy can help to inform the ethical and moral principles that guide the design and development of software for knowledge work. For example, the principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability may be central to the development of software that supports knowledge workers, and these principles may be grounded in philosophical theories of justice or moral reasoning.\n\nWeb science, which is the study of the structure, evolution, and use of the World Wide Web, can also be important for the production of software for knowledge work. Web science can provide insights into how people use and interact with software, as well as how to design software that is user-friendly and effective.\n\nEconomics, meanwhile, can help to inform the business and financial aspects of software development for knowledge work. This may include considerations such as the cost of development, pricing models, and the potential return on investment. Economics can also help to analyze the potential economic impacts of software for knowledge work, such as its effects on productivity and efficiency.\n\nIn relation to the activity of performing knowledge work; the amount of time it takes to comprehend and form the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to create a derivative artifact can be significantly longer than the time it takes to actually create the artifact. This is because knowledge work often involves complex, non-routine tasks that require a high level of education, training, or experience.\n\nFor example, the process of designing a concept for a web application may involve a significant amount of time spent researching and analyzing user needs, studying existing solutions, and conceptualizing and prototyping different design approaches. This process of understanding and planning can take weeks, months, or even years, depending on the complexity of the project.\n\nOn the other hand, the process of implementing the web application solution as software may involve a shorter amount of time, as it involves following a detailed plan or set of instructions to build the actual software. This implementation phase may still require a high level of skill and expertise, but it typically relies on a foundation of understanding and planning that has already been established.\n\nOverall, the amount of time it takes to comprehend and form the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to create a derivative artifact can vary greatly depending on the complexity and scope of the project. However, in general, this process of comprehension and understanding can take significantly longer than the actual process of creating the artifact.\n\nHistorically, \n\nThere are several economic methodologies that were able to be used to compensate individuals who have produced valuable works through knowledge work, even if they were not paid for their work while it was being produced. \n\nSome of those potential options included:\n\n1.  Royalties: A royalty is a payment made to the creator of a work based on the number of copies sold or the amount of revenue generated by the work. This model can be used to ensure that creators are compensated for the value that their work generates over time.\n    \n2.  Licensing: A licensing agreement allows the creator of a work to grant permission to others to use the work in exchange for a fee. This model can be used to ensure that creators are compensated for the use of their work, even if they are not directly involved in the distribution or sale of the work.\n    \n3.  Equity: In some cases, creators may be able to negotiate for an ownership stake in the company or venture that is using their work. This can provide them with a share of the profits or value generated by the work.\n    \n4.  Crowdfunding: Crowdfunding platforms allow creators to seek financial support from a large number of people, typically through small contributions. This model can be used to raise funds for the production of a work, and can also help to build a community of supporters around the work.\n    \n\n### Relationship between Fair Terms and Taxation\nIf knowledge workers are unpaid or solely funded via universal basic income (UBI), it is likely to have an impact on taxation income. UBI is a form of social security that provides a guaranteed income to all citizens, regardless of their employment status or income level.\n\nIf knowledge workers are receiving UBI as their primary source of income, it is likely that they will not be paying taxes on their income, as UBI is typically designed to be tax-free. This could reduce the overall amount of taxation income collected by the government.\n\nOn the other hand, if knowledge workers are not being paid for their work at all, it is possible that they may be reliant on other forms of government assistance, such as welfare payments or unemployment benefits. In this case, the government may still be incurring costs to support these individuals, even if they are not generating taxation income through their work.\n\nOverall, the impact of unpaid or UBI-funded knowledge workers on taxation income will depend on the specific details of the UBI program and the broader economic context.\n\n### Relationship between Economics and Intellectual Property\nIf knowledge workers who produce valuable intellectual property are not compensated or acknowledged for their contributions towards works that are later commercially exploited by others without lawful licensing rights, it can have a number of negative impacts on intellectual property rights.\n\nFirst and foremost, it can undermine the principle of fair compensation for intellectual property, which is a key aspect of intellectual property law. If knowledge workers are not being fairly compensated for their contributions, it can discourage them from continuing to create and innovate, which can have a negative impact on the overall development and growth of the field.\n\nIn addition, the unauthorized exploitation of intellectual property can also lead to disputes and legal conflicts. If knowledge workers are not properly compensated or credited for their work, they may seek legal remedies to protect their rights and seek fair compensation. This can result in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings, which can be disruptive to businesses and industries that rely on the exploitation of intellectual property.\n\nOverall, it is important to ensure that knowledge workers who produce valuable intellectual property are fairly compensated and acknowledged for their contributions. This can help to promote a healthy and vibrant intellectual property ecosystem, which is essential for fostering innovation and economic growth.\n\nIn general, it is not lawful to obtain intellectual property from a knowledge worker if they are not compensated for their work. Intellectual property law provides legal protections for the creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. These protections typically include the right to be compensated for the use of the intellectual property.\n\nIf a knowledge worker creates a work that is protected by intellectual property law, they have the right to be compensated for its use. This may include payment for the use of the work, or an agreement to share in the profits generated by the work. Without such an agreement, it is typically not lawful to use the work without the knowledge worker's consent.\n\nThere are some limited exceptions to this rule, such as the \"fair use\" doctrine in copyright law, which allows for limited use of copyrighted works without permission in certain circumstances, such as for the purpose of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, these exceptions are typically narrow and do not allow for the unrestricted use of intellectual property without compensation.\n\nOverall, it is important to ensure that knowledge workers are fairly compensated for their valuable intellectual property in order to respect their rights and promote a healthy and vibrant intellectual property ecosystem.\n\nThrough the development of the [[WorkProject]] new solutions become available.

This could include rates of return in the range of 10-20% or higher.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these rates are only estimates, and the actual rate of return that an investor or lender is seeking may vary significantly based on the specific details of the project and the investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives. It is also worth noting that the rate of return sought by an investor or lender may not necessarily reflect the rate of return that the project is able to generate.\n\nOverall, it is important for entrepreneurs seeking funding for early stage projects to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any unsecured loans they are considering, including the rate of return being sought by the investor or lender.\n\nQ: What is the typical return on investment expectation for Early Stage Venture Capital?\n\nA: The typical return on investment (ROI) expectation for early stage venture capital can vary widely depending on a number of factors, including the stage of the company, the industry sector, and the specific investment strategy of the venture capital firm.\n\nIn general, venture capital firms that invest in early stage companies are typically seeking higher rates of return to compensate for the higher level of risk involved. According to some estimates, venture capital firms may typically aim for an ROI of 3-5 times their initial investment over a period of 5-7 years.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these are only estimates, and the actual ROI achieved by a venture capital firm may vary significantly based on the specific details of the investment. Venture capital investing is generally considered to be a high-risk, high-reward proposition, and it is not uncommon for some investments to fail to deliver any return, while others may achieve significantly higher returns.\n\nOverall, it is important for entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any investment offer, including the expected ROI and the time frame in which the venture capital firm expects to see a return on its investment.\n\n**Q:**  What would be the fixed rate of return if the compensatory amount for a successful venture was capped to a specified fixed multiplier or percentage, for an early stage project?\n\nA: The fixed rate of return if the compensatory amount for a successful venture is capped to a specified fixed multiplier or percentage for an early stage project would depend on the specific terms and conditions of the investment.\n\nFor example, if the compensatory amount is capped at a fixed multiplier of 2x the initial investment, and the initial investment is $100,000, the fixed rate of return would be 100% (2x the initial investment), assuming that the project is successful and the cap is reached.\n\nOn the other hand, if the compensatory amount is capped at a fixed percentage of the initial investment, such as 50%, and the initial investment is $100,000, the fixed rate of return would be $50,000 (50% of the initial investment), assuming that the project is successful and the cap is reached.\n\nIt is important to note that fixed multipliers and percentages can be used in a variety of different investment structures, and the specific terms and conditions of an investment will vary depending on the specific details of the project and the preferences of the investor. It is up to the investor to carefully consider the terms and conditions of the investment, including any caps on the compensatory amount, before making a decision. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/EconomicSystems/WorkProject/LicensingFrameworks/","title":"Licensing Frameworks"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Licensing Frameworks\n\n\nThe Licensing Frameworks for [[KnowledgeWork]] are different to traditional open-source licensing solutions.

These provisions can determine which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the terms of the agreement, and can therefore impact the rights and obligations of the parties.\n> \n> For example, choice of law provisions can affect the level of protection afforded to user data and the rights of users to access and control their data. They can also impact the liability of the online platform for any breaches of the terms of service or for any harm caused to users as a result of the platform's actions or failures.\n> \n> In addition, choice of law provisions can affect the enforceability of the terms of the agreement and the ability of users to bring legal actions against the online platform. They can also impact the availability of remedies for any breaches of the agreement, such as damages or injunctive relief.\n> \n> Overall, choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems that store user information can have significant implications for the rights and obligations of the parties involved and can affect the enforceability and effectiveness of the agreement.\n> \n> In order to ensure that choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems are effective and enforceable, it is important for the parties to carefully consider the jurisdiction whose laws will apply to the agreement. This may involve considering factors such as the location of the parties, the location of the online platform, and the nature of the services being provided.\n> \n> It may also be necessary to consider the laws of multiple jurisdictions, as online systems may operate globally and may be subject to the laws of multiple countries. In these cases, it may be necessary to include provisions that specify which laws will apply in different circumstances or that allow the parties to choose which laws will apply.\n> \n> Overall, choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems can have significant implications for the parties involved, and it is important for the parties to carefully consider which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the agreement in order to ensure that the provisions are effective and enforceable.\n\nQ: What are the implications if a user is considered to be a 'legal alien' (ie: foreigner) in relation to the elected choice of law provision in a terms of service contract?\n\n> A: If a user is considered to be a \"legal alien\" (i.e., a foreigner) in relation to the elected choice of law provision in a terms of service contract, there may be several implications for the user. Some of these implications could include:\n> \n> 1.  Limited legal protections: The laws of the jurisdiction chosen in the choice of law provision may not provide the same level of legal protection to foreign users as they do to domestic users. This could leave foreign users more vulnerable to harm or abuse.\n\n> 2.  Difficulty enforcing rights: If a foreign user wishes to enforce their rights under the terms of service contract, they may face challenges in doing so if the chosen jurisdiction's laws do not provide them with adequate legal protections or if the jurisdiction does not have a strong legal system.\n \n> 3.  Higher costs: Foreign users may also face higher costs in enforcing their rights or seeking remedies for any breaches of the terms of service contract, as they may need to retain legal counsel in the chosen jurisdiction or engage in litigation in a foreign court.\n   \n> Overall, if a user is considered to be a \"legal alien\" in relation to the elected choice of law provision in a terms of service contract, they may face challenges in enforcing their rights and may have limited legal protections under the chosen jurisdiction's laws.\n\n\n> If a user is considered to be a \"legal alien\" (i.e., a foreigner) in relation to intellectual property rights (IPR), there may be several implications for the user.

In this case, there is a broader ecosystem framework that is thought to provide a scaffolding framework to support the development of solutions to this, and many other problems.  However, as these works need to be done; and that there isn't possibly the means to find and structure,\n1. The means to formerally engage in a manner akin to contract and/or employment agreements all persons who may be able to contribute usefully in some way big or small; and that,\n2. the means to find all the money needed to pay everyone for work that they may or may not do well is not practically feasible; and that,\n3. Projects such as the [[ValueAccountingInitiatives]] (including [Slicing Pie](https://slicingpie.com/learn-slicing-pie-model/)) and in a different way GitHub (ie: The [DevDocs project](https://github.com/webizenai/devdocs/)) illustrate various parts of a broader solution that can be structured and made able to work; now therefore,\n\nPart of the underlying solution, requires a means to provide a 'fair value' for the work-effort of a person; which may thereafter be associated to a variety of other paramaters; such as,\n\n4. The licensing context (ie: exclusively provided?  or provided, and able to be used by other projects)\n5. The Location and use of  Purchasing Power Parity ( #ppp ) [see OECD example](https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm)\n6. The Context in which the work was done (ie: a requirement that was needed immediately or at some scheduled time; or something that was done on an unsolicited basis)\n7. The Context in which the work was either funded or sought to be subject to compensatory terms based upon the usefulness and/or successful employment of the works derivatives.\n\nThere are others; and this area is to be explored in a more fulsome way as the documentation develops.  \n\n### Australian Context\nWebizen is currently being produced from Australia.  Therefore the modelling that i am best able to provide at the moment is through the lens of the Australian Context, and thereby using PPP Methods to adjust for foreign contexts.

It is generally understood to mean that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired result, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result.\n\nIn contrast, behavior that is intentionally harmful, exploitative, or a willful breach of an agreement of fair dealings would involve a conscious choice to act in a way that is detrimental to others or that goes against the terms of an agreement. This type of behavior would not be considered to be making a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as it would be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions rather than a desire to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nTo expand on my interpretation, \"best efforts\" refers to an obligation or promise to use a reasonable level of care and diligence in achieving a particular result. This means that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired outcome, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result. This means that if something goes wrong or the desired result is not achieved, it is not necessarily a breach of the obligation as long as the person has made a good faith effort to achieve the result.\n\nIn contrast, mistakes that are made intentionally are different because they involve a conscious choice to act in a certain way, rather than being an unintentional or unforeseen outcome. Intentional mistakes are typically made with the knowledge that they are likely to result in a negative outcome, and may be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions. These mistakes would not be considered to be made in good faith or as a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as the person making the mistake is acting in a way that is not in line with the goal or purpose of the activity.\n\nSource: Chat.OpenAi.com"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/HumanCentricAI/SocialOntology/FitForPurpose/","title":"Fit For Purpose"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Fit For Purpose\n\n*Content produced quickly via ChatGPT*\n\n>*When designing tools that form part of an ecosystems solution that is implemented using software and socio-economic systems; how would you define a rule or condition that a useful component should be 'fit for purpose', define 'fit for purpose'..*\n\nThe term \"fit for purpose\" refers to the extent to which a product, service, or system is suitable or appropriate for the specific purpose or use for which it was designed. When designing tools as part of an ecosystem solution that is implemented using software and socio-economic systems, it is important to ensure that each component is \"fit for purpose\" in order to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of the overall solution.\n\nTo ensure that a component is \"fit for purpose,\" it is necessary to consider a number of different factors. These might include the specific requirements or needs of the users or stakeholders who will be interacting with the component, the technical capabilities and limitations of the component, and any regulatory or compliance requirements that must be met.\n\nOverall, a component is considered \"fit for purpose\" if it meets the specific needs and requirements of the users or stakeholders, and if it performs the functions it was designed to perform in an effective and efficient manner.\n\n\n> *What sorts of considerations should be made to evaluate whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular usecase?*\n\nThere are several considerations that should be made when evaluating whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular use case. Some of the key considerations might include:\n\n1.  The specific requirements or needs of the users or stakeholders: It is important to carefully consider the specific needs and requirements of the users or stakeholders who will be interacting with the solution. This might include factors such as the tasks they will be performing, the information they need to access, and any specific constraints or limitations they may face.\n    \n2.  The technical capabilities and limitations of the solution: It is also important to consider the technical capabilities and limitations of the solution, and to ensure that it is capable of performing the tasks it was designed to perform. This might include factors such as the performance, scalability, and reliability of the solution.\n    \n3.  Any regulatory or compliance requirements: Depending on the context in which the solution will be used, there may be certain regulatory or compliance requirements that must be met. It is important to carefully consider these requirements and to ensure that the solution is compliant.\n    \n4.  The cost and value of the solution: It is also important to consider the cost of the solution and to ensure that it provides good value for money. This might involve comparing the cost of the solution to the benefits it is expected to provide, and determining whether the benefits outweigh the costs.\n    \n\nOverall, these are just a few of the key considerations that should be made when evaluating whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular use case.\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/HumanCentricAI/SocialOntology/pedagogy/","title":"Pedagogy"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"**Pedagogy** ([/ˈpɛdəɡɒdʒi, -ɡoʊdʒi, -ɡɒɡi/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\")), most commonly understood as the approach to [teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching \"Teaching\"), is the theory and practice of [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning \"Learning\"), and how this process influences, and is influenced by, the social, political and [psychological development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology \"Developmental psychology\") of learners. Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place during learning. Both the theory and practice of pedagogy vary greatly as they reflect different social, political, and cultural contexts.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy#cite_note-1)\n\nSource; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/HumanCentricAI/SocialOntology/LearningModals/","title":"Learning Modals"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Learning Modals\n\n## What is Learning?\n\nLearning is the process of acquiring new knowledge, skills, behaviors, or attitudes through experience, study, or training. Learning can take place in a variety of contexts, including in formal educational settings, such as schools or universities, or informally, through life experiences or self-directed study.\n\nThere are many different approaches to learning, and people learn in different ways. Some people may learn more effectively through hands-on experience, while others may learn better through reading or listening to lectures.\n\nLearning can be a continuous process that occurs throughout a person's life, as they encounter new situations and experiences that challenge them to learn and adapt. It can also be a deliberate process, as people may seek out learning opportunities in order to acquire new knowledge or skills.\n\nOverall, learning is a fundamental aspect of human development and is essential for personal and professional growth and success.\n\n### The Use of Open Badges with Webizen\n\n[[OpenBadges]]  can be used to provide recognition of prior learning for knowledge workers via systems that support Webizen AI agents in a number of ways:\n\n1.  Recognition of skills and expertise: AI agents can be used to assess the skills and expertise of knowledge workers and issue Open Badges to recognize their learning and achievements. This can help to provide evidence of skills and abilities that may be difficult to demonstrate through traditional methods.\n    \n2.  Verification of learning: Open Badges can be used to verify the learning and achievements of knowledge workers, helping to ensure that their skills and expertise are accurately represented.\n    \n3.  Portability of learning: Open Badges can be easily shared and displayed on a variety of online platforms, making it easier for knowledge workers to share their learning and achievements with others. This can be particularly useful for knowledge workers who may work in a variety of different settings or who may be seeking to demonstrate their skills to potential employers or clients.\n    \n\nOverall, Open Badges can be a useful tool for providing recognition of prior learning for knowledge workers via systems that support AI agents, helping to provide evidence of skills and expertise and making it easier to share learning and achievements with others.\n\n### Objective\n\nThe objective is to improve the way people are able to be supported by recgonition of prior learning applications of [[CognitiveAI]] tooling.  These systems will seek to develop an evidence base to support a conclusion that a person can be asserted to have knowledge of concepts, things, fields of expertise and other factors of importance in relation to the performance of new work activities, as is in-turn made possible by the prior performance of activities. \n\nIn-part, what this constituency seeks to form a means to address, relates to innovation in particular; but also, an array of other socio-economic and governance factors.  \n\nWithin the field of innovation, people work on new ideas that form new 'things', of various types.  Yet traditional / historical means of qualification have been mostly focused upon the use of academic facilities; who do not offer qualifications about the knowledge of a field that is presently being invented.  The consequence is that the people who were instrumental to the creation of a new field of expertise, are subsequently not considered to be qualified in the area and consequentially; both, discriminated against due to not having done a course relating to the field (only available later); and in-turn somewhat forced to pay 'rents' to obtain qualifications for an area that they may have been involved in creating / inventing!.\n\nThe commonly accepted solution for this problem, is to simply pay the 'rents' or suffer the consequences.\n\nThe other area illustrated, about improving [[ESG]] support (in-effect); is that projects that are run by groups may in-turn nominate a person to take-on a role that they are not competently equipped to perform; and as a consequence of these sorts of practices, harms may in-turn be incurred by others - that may well be of a kind, that has no appropriate available lawful remedy.  \n\nIn a similar yet different area; a person may be charged with the responsibility of providing an analysis of a situation and acting or failing to act in a circumstance that has material consequences upon others; but they've not got the skills to comprehend some sort of important facts, due to a lack of skills or knowledge in that area.  Consequentially the person may act negligently and/or engage in - what is in-effect - an act of violence, and then seek protection at a later time, irraspective of the consequences put upon others.  At which stage, the situation may in-turn become adverserial and the victim is unlikely to be resourced with lawful remedy, compensation and/or even simply an otherwise appropriate apology and whatever further actions may need to take place in-order to resolve the consequences of that persons mistakes; as was in-turn put, upon others.  These sorts of situations undermine 'good faith' relations and in-turn often invoke further wrong-doings as the mistakes of one person, may in-turn lead to an array of other persons seeking to cover up and/or protect the wrong-doer, irraspective of whether it was an honest mistake or a willful act of violence causing injury.\n\nSo the learning modals, seek to support sense-making to more rapidly produce contextually useful insights and related links that support a means to process the circumstances of a persons learning and seek to mitigate risks of events that may lead to disputes and/or [[SocialAttackVectors]] that may negatively impact a legal entities [[ESG]] and/or insurability status.\n\nAdditionally, the objective is to produce systems that can provide categorised qualification  [[Ontologies]] and [[TemporalSemantics]] that is in-turn intended to support [[CognitiveAI]] processes (noting the importance of: [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] ) and thereby providing support for [[VerifiableCredentials]] in relation to this field of [[WhatIsWebScience]] and its means to address various [[SocialFactors]].\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/EngineeringConsiderations/CryptographicSignatures/","title":"Cryptographic Signatures"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Cryptographic Signatures\n\nThe resources made available via permissive commons need to be tamper evident.\n\nThe use of technology to support tamper-evidence of content that is to be consumed by an Agent, should both support the webizen ecosystem and where possible others more broadly.\n\n### Consideration of Related Problems\n\n#### Resource Links\n\nIf the URI of the resource is generated as a consequence of publishing the artifact, then how do you create the resource URI prior to publishing the document to a system that will in-turn generate a URI as a consequence of publishing the artifact.  In some systems, where an append only or simliar function is performed; then, a Genesis Block containing the first elements of information about that artifact needs to be generated prior to appending other links to it; and in-turn, whilst there is a capacity to know what the previous documents URI is when structing the document, it is less clear how to pre-determine what the URI for the newly published document version. \n\nWhere the below notes state 'documents' the intended meaning includes binaries and other  forms of digital assets / artifacts.\n\n1.

The implications of making any modifications to DNS brings with it an array of potential benefits; that could be enormously significant; but also, an array of risks and potential downsides.\n\nPresently the Public Internet uses the DNS system that is governed by [ICANN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN).\n\nThis is the underlying system that is in-turn responsible for the way through which domain names are rented.  \n\nAn alternative for domains has been created by a range of [Blockchain based solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Domain_names) yet, these solutions are moreover considered to be categorised as components of the [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) ecosystem, which is basically considered to be blockchain based. \n\nAfter several years, works on [[DIDs]] has evolved to provide some form of solution that is supported by a [DID Methods Registry](https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/tree/main/methods) yet, this methodology provides far less namespace than the DNS system in and of itself.  These works create a bridge between Web (WWW / W3C / HTTP) based ecosystems, and those that strongly rely upon [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) technology.\n\nThere are an array of DNS related technologies that are able to provide significant security improvements, however they are not necessarily reliably in-place nor necessarily able to work with all internet connected devices that depend upon existing ICANN related DNS systems.\n\nA possible opportunity might be to look to create an alternative DNS solution that might be operated by the Permissive Commons Agent specifically. If this were to be considered, then it would be important that any engineered alternative did not conflict with the existing public DNS ecosystem, rather, work to seek to compliment that system; and perhaps offer some opportunity for future work to be done by others to upgrade the public DNS system to support any good ideas that may be implemented via an alternative.   \n\nOne of the questions that these ideas therefore bring about is; whether or not these opportunities should be applied upon the entire permissive commons technology ecosystem for all supported usecases, or whether it should only apply for use-cases that employ webizen related technology. At present, i am unsure.\n\n### Functionality Considerations\n\n##### DNS based DID like records;\nIn-order to support the means to address the different types of [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]] that may be providing permissive commons assets, an idea is that the creation of new DNS records might provide a capacity to provide support for these sorts of requirements. \n\nThis would in-turn provide a means to support discovery of resources that are supported by the host as determined by the DNS records.  If this were to be developed, new types of DNS records or a schema to define how these new types of DNS records would need to be defined. \n\n##### WebID-DNS\nThe WebID ecosystem is defined elsewhere.  Whilst there may be other considerations relating to the approach for making use of WebID or WebID like technologies; it may well be that the use of a domain name record to denote a particular entity is a potentially useful way to support a means to provide related semantics and in-turn also, support for authentication.\n\nYet, this would in-turn infer the use of particular types of cryptographic instruments to support the underlying requirements associated with any such approach; also, any content that may be encoded in a manner that defines the namespace, should also be temporally considered - ensuring the relationship between any such domain-name holder, and any authors / human agents; is able to be informatically supported (ie: correct inferences) overtime.  \n\nThe other factor relating to this type of methodology is that it would therefore be preferred that the domain name used, is not rented but rather owned by whatever legal entity relates to the informatics use of that domain name as a legal entity related identifier. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/EngineeringConsiderations/EnergyConsumption/","title":"Energy Consumption"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Energy Consumption\n\nThe Ecosystems implementation should support a capacity to perform and/or consider various aspects related to energy consumption; and in-particalar therein, the relationship between the creation of records / electronic resources, and the volume of energy that is required to make that record available by whatever means has been elected for it. \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/EngineeringConsiderations/ForTheGoodOfHumanity/","title":"ForTheGoodOfHumanity"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Permissive Commons technology must be developed 'for the good of humanity', and whilst this production of this technology is considered to be an important part of the webizen ecosystem; the use of the permissive commons technology should not require users to have purchased a webizen or be required to participate in the webizen network; other than where necessary in relation to specified and unadvoidable webizen related usecases. \n\nThe software license for making use of Permissive Commons Technology should seek to instill some basic values that are considered reasonably shared as universal values for all of mankind.

Rather than the concept of 'opt-in' or 'consent', the concept of 'values credentials' relates to 'human agency', and the ability and desirability for human beings as foundationally important active

If their ideologies were fully supported, then they wouldn't pay for internet at all and would therefore not be made able to publically endorse the ideology thereby put upon others, in a manner that is not uniform.  The uniformity of principals is reasonably considered to be a default position that should be usefully required, although not necessarily enforced; which thereby gets into an array of complex issues, that are sought to be addressed at a later stage (ie: when there's a webizen system that's working at least to some-degree).  \n\nTraditionally; systems have had different policies that relate to the context of the user.  this is one of many potential mechanisms that should be able to be applied; yet moreover,\n\nThe point of this note; is that, the amount of time a human being employs to create something usefully employed by others, isn't 'free'.

The outcome should ensure that any materials produced for the benefit of human kind are not made unaccessible due to financially discriminatory practices; nor, that any such works should require payments in perpetuity, rather, an appropriate and proportionate balance should be defined.

It is concerned with how time is expressed, interpreted, and understood in natural languages, and with the ways in which time affects the interpretation of words, sentences, and texts.\n\nTemporal semantics is an important area of research in linguistics, philosophy, computer science, and other fields. It has a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation, and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn natural language, time can be expressed in many different ways, including through words, phrases, and grammatical constructions that denote past, present, and future events. Temporal semantics is concerned with understanding how these expressions are used to convey temporal information, and with the ways in which this information can be interpreted and used by speakers and listeners.\n\nIn addition to studying the temporal aspects of natural language, temporal semantics also investigates the ways in which time is represented and manipulated in computational systems, such as database systems, knowledge bases, and artificial intelligence systems. It is concerned with developing formal models and methods for representing and reasoning about time in these systems, and with the ways in which these models and methods can be used to support a wide range of applications.\n\nThe use of 'Temporal Semantics' is critical to the entire ecosystem; and one of many related objectives include employing the techniques to address [SocialAttackVectors](SocialAttackVectors.md) that employ temporal factors as part of the attack method; alongside, an array of happier purposes for providing support for temporal semantics.\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols #RuleOfLaw "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/EngineeringConsiderations/VersionControl/","title":"Version Control"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Version Control\n\nThe version control requirements have interactions with the [[TemporalSemantics]] requirements. \n\nThere is a requirement to;\n\n- Ensure that the assets published are able to be targeted by the specified version of the resource.\n- Ensure that there is a capacity to target the collection of versions of the resource.\n- Support [[PublishingWorkflow]] requirements in relation to any version or variant\n- Be able to target the latest version or variant of a resource.\n- Be able to target a specific version of a resource based upon one or more particular qualities relating to the resource series.\n- Make use of [[CryptographicSignatures]] to support informatics integrity.\n- Where applicable; enable the means to 'fork' and without destruction of rights; support the growth of new derivatives, emboidments and further works that may employ existing works as a template or means for supporting the development of a different version or something new.\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/HyperMediaContainers/","title":"HyperMedia Containers"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# HyperMedia Containers\n\nThe concept of a Hypermedia container was first considered in relation to the development of the HybridTV works in 2007-8 that related to works progressed in Europe (HbbTV) and the UK (Project Kangaroo) in particular.

A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'. and,\n\nThe term Human Centric refers to the orientation of information management systems that centre upon the rights, responsibilities and moral ownership of electronic records pertaining to a human being. \n\nSome Human Beings are not able to make legal decisions or hold legal responsibility on their own behalf.  This may be due to disability, psychiatric illness, aging related conditions, emergency medical situations as well as consideration for the needs of children.  This may be considered to relate to persons who have some sort of guardianship requirements to support the persons human rights.\n\nIf each Adult Human being is able to own, store and operate their own data / information and manage their own authentication and permissions systems, but that this cannot be achieved for persons who require some sort of guardianship support; how could systems be designed to support the safety and human dignity / human rights of persons who require guardianship related shared permissions structures and how could those permission structures be defined to support the persons human rights / human dignity?\n\n\nChat AI:\n\nDesigning systems that support the safety and human rights of individuals who require guardianship can be a complex task, as it involves balancing the need to protect the individual's rights and dignity with the need to ensure their safety. One approach to this problem is to use a combination of technical and policy-based solutions.\n\nIn terms of technical solutions, systems can be designed to support flexible permission structures that can be tailored to the specific needs of each individual. For example, the system could allow for different levels of access and control depending on the individual's needs and abilities. For example, individuals who require more support may have more limited access to their data, while those who are able to make decisions on their own may have more autonomy.\n\nIn terms of policy-based solutions, systems can be designed to incorporate principles such as transparency, accountability, and privacy by design. These principles can help ensure that the system is designed with the protection of the individual's rights and dignity in mind, and that any decisions or actions taken on their behalf are fully justified and transparent.\n\nIn addition, having clear protocols for guardianship and determining guardianship, and clear transparent communication channels for guardianship decision making would be essential. This can be achieved by having legal frameworks that clearly outline the responsibilities and rights of all parties involved, as well as regular reviews to ensure that the individual's needs are being met and that the guardianship is still needed.\n\nUltimately, it is important to involve individuals who require guardianship, their guardians and other stakeholders in the design process to ensure that the system is tailored to their specific needs and that it meets their safety, security and human rights standards.\n\n\nQ: if a person who requires guardianship is defined as a dependant; who still retains human rights, but is dependant upon one or more others to be supported to maintain a beneficial relationship with those rights; What technical designs could provide the dependent their own digital human agency, perhaps through the ownership of a database that contains their information; but is supported by others who also have access? how might the information be categorised to appropriately provide support, as well as maintaining the dependants right to privacy and freedom of thought?\n\nChatGPT:\n*One approach to providing a dependent with their own digital human agency, while also supporting them with access to their information, could be to use a decentralized database system. This type of system would allow the dependent to have control over their own data, while also allowing designated individuals, such as guardians, to have access to the data as needed.*\n\n*The information in the database could be organized in such a way that it supports the dependent's needs and rights, while also protecting their privacy. For example, sensitive personal information could be kept private and only shared with designated individuals on a need-to-know basis. Information that is needed to support the dependent's daily needs could be more easily accessible by their guardians.*\n\n*One way to organize the information to support the dependent is to use a hierarchical structure where personal data is separated into different levels of privacy and accessibility. For example, the dependent could have full control over the highest level of data, which includes information such as their medical history, contact information, and personal preferences. The lower level of data is shared with the designated guardians or support people and it can contain information such as appointments, social and other interactions that the dependant would have.*\n\n*Another design solution could be to use a permission-based system, where the dependent and their guardians can assign different levels of access to the data for different individuals or groups. For example, the dependent may allow their primary guardian to have full access to all of their data, while other family members or caregivers may have more limited access. Additionally, consider setting up expiration dates for access, so that the data is not indefinitely accessible.*\n\n*To maintain the dependent's right to privacy and freedom of thought, it is also important to have clear policies and procedures in place for handling data, as well as regular audits to ensure that the system is in compliance with regulations, standards and to assure dependant's information is being handled appropriately. Additionally, involving the dependant in the decision making process and choices of the systems, protocols and policies that would be employed to support their human agency can help ensure that their needs and rights are being met.*\n\n*Another important aspect of maintaining the dependent's right to privacy and freedom of thought is to provide them with the necessary tools and resources to understand and manage their own data. This could include providing training and education on how to use the database and permission system, as well as giving them access to clear and easy-to-understand information about their rights and the policies and procedures that apply to their data.*\n\n*Additionally, involving the dependent in the decision-making process when it comes to the use of their data, can be essential. For example, they can have a voice in which of the data they allow to be shared with which parties, and under what conditions.*\n\n*Finally, it is important to have robust security measures in place to protect the dependent's data from unauthorized access or misuse. This can include using encryption, secure authentication methods, and regular backups to protect the data from loss or damage.*\n\n*In summary, providing a dependent with their own digital human agency can be achieved through the use of decentralized databases and permission-based systems that allow the dependent to have control over their own data, while also allowing designated individuals to have access as needed. The system should be designed to support the dependent's needs and rights, while also protecting their privacy, including through the use of hierarchical data structure, expiration date of access, and involving the dependant in the decision making process of sharing and managing the data. To maintain dependant's rights, security measures must be in place, as well as clear policies and procedures for handling the data, regular audits and involving dependant in the decision making process.*\n\nQ: What sorts of policy based mechanisms would be required and/or beneficial to support the human rights of the dependant?\n\nChatGPT:\n\n*There are a variety of policy-based mechanisms that can be implemented to support the human rights of a dependent. Some of these include:*\n\n1.  *Clear legal frameworks: Establishing clear legal frameworks that outline the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved in supporting the dependent, including their guardians, caregivers, and family members. These frameworks should also provide guidelines for decision making and dispute resolution.*\n    \n2.  *Human rights-based approach: Ensuring that the approach taken to support the dependent is based on the principles of human rights, including the right to autonomy, privacy, and dignity. This should include regular reviews of the dependent's needs and the effectiveness of the support being provided, to ensure that their rights are being respected.*\n    \n3.  *Transparency and accountability: Implementing systems and procedures that promote transparency and accountability in the handling of the dependent's data and in the decision-making process around their care. This can include regular reporting, regular audits, and mechanisms for addressing grievances.*\n    \n4.  *Privacy and security: Developing and implementing policies and procedures that protect the dependent's privacy and personal information, including strict protocols for data handling, regular security reviews, and the use of encryption, authentication and access control mechanisms.*\n    \n5.  *Participation and informed consent: Involving the dependent in the decision-making process, providing them with the information necessary to understand the choices being made, and ensuring that they are able to provide informed consent.*\n    \n6.  *Independent oversight: Having independent oversight and regular review mechanisms to ensure that the dependent's rights are being respected and protected, and to identify and address any concerns or issues that may arise.*\n    \n7.  *Monitoring: Establishing regular monitoring, reporting and review mechanisms to ensure compliance with the above mentioned policy based mechanisms and identify and addressing any issues.*\n    \n\n*It is important to note that, depending on the specific context and needs of the dependent, additional policy mechanisms may be necessary to ensure their human rights are protected.*\n\n\nQ: If a dependant is unable to independently own or lawfully protect (ie: via courts of law) their own rights relating the ownership, storage and use of their own personal and private information; how might a legal structure be devised to support their needs, with the support of others?\n\nChatGPT:\n\n*If a dependent is unable to independently own or lawfully protect their own rights relating to the ownership, storage, and use of their personal and private information, a legal structure could be devised to support their needs with the support of others.*\n\n*One approach could be to establish a legal guardianship or conservatorship system. This would involve a legal process where a designated guardian or conservator is appointed by a court to make decisions on the dependent's behalf regarding their personal and private information. The guardian or conservator would be responsible for managing the dependent's data and ensuring that their rights and interests are protected.*\n\n*Another approach could be to establish a legal trust, where the dependent's data would be held in trust by a designated trustee. The trustee would be responsible for managing and protecting the dependent's data, in accordance with the terms of the trust and any court orders. This legal trust can be tailored to the specific needs of the dependant and the level of autonomy they wish to retain.*\n\n*The legal structure that is chosen would need to be in compliance with the local jurisdiction laws, while also taking into account of the needs and autonomy of the dependent person. Additionally, it would need to be reviewed and updated on regular basis.*\n\n*In both cases, the legal structure would need to provide for oversight and accountability to ensure that the dependent's rights and interests are protected, and to address any issues or concerns that may arise. This could be through regular reporting, regular reviews, or mechanisms for dispute resolution, as appropriate.*\n\n*It is also important to consider involving a range of stakeholders in the design and implementation of such legal structures, such as the dependant, their guardians, family members and other support people. This will help ensure that the legal structure meets the specific needs of the dependent, respects their autonomy and rights, and is tailored to the dependant's individual needs and circumstances.*\n\n*Another approach to support the needs of dependants with the support of others could be by creating a power of attorney (POA). A power of attorney is a legal document that gives someone else the authority to make decisions on behalf of the person who has granted the POA. This could be a general POA which gives someone the authority to make all types of decisions, or a specific POA which gives someone the authority to make specific types of decisions related to personal and private information. In this case, the person granting the POA (the principal) would have the right to choose who their attorney-in-fact (the person they have chosen to act on their behalf) will be, and what kind of power they will have. The attorney-in-fact should act in the best interest of the principal, and in this case of the dependent, the attorney-in-fact would manage the dependent's personal and private information according to the terms of the POA and the best interest of the dependent.*\n\n*Another potential legal solution that might support dependants and their rights over their personal and private information, could be the creation of a legal representative. This could be a person, or an organization that is legally designated to represent the dependent in the management and protection of their personal and private information. This legal representative would be responsible for making decisions related to the dependent's information, such as sharing it with others or managing the privacy settings, and would act in the best interest of the dependent, while also complying with legal requirements.*\n\n*It is also important to mention that, any solution that is chosen, it should not limit or restrict the dependent's rights more than is necessary to protect their best interests and they should be included in the decision making process and have the right to revoke the legal structure if they choose to do so.*\n\n*In summary, there are a number of legal structures that can be devised to support the needs of dependants with the support of others, such as legal guardianship or conservatorship, legal trust, power of attorney, and legal representative. The specific legal structure chosen will depend on the jurisdiction and the specific needs and circumstances of the dependent. It is important to note that, regardless of the legal structure chosen, it should prioritize the dependent's autonomy and rights while also ensuring they are protected and their best interest is taken into account.*\n\nQ: How could a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier; be devised using contract law between private individuals, that may in-turn expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met?\n\nChatGPT:\n\n*It is possible to devise a solution using contract law between private individuals that attends to the considerations provided earlier and that may expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met. One example of such a contract could be a personal data management contract.*\n\n*This type of contract would outline the terms and conditions of how the dependent's personal and private information will be managed and protected. The contract would be between the dependent (or the person legally responsible for them) and the person or organization designated to manage their data, such as a guardian, attorney-in-fact, or legal representative. The contract would include information such as the scope of the data that is being managed, the rights and responsibilities of each party, and the conditions under which the contract may be terminated or modified.*\n\n*The contract could include an expiration clause, which would specify a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. For example, the contract could expire when the dependent reaches a certain age or when their condition improves to a point where they are able to manage their data independently.*\n\n*In addition, the contract should include provisions for regular reviews of the terms and conditions of the contract to ensure that it is still meeting the needs of the dependent and that their rights are being protected. It should also include provisions for dispute resolution, in case of any disagreement about the contract's terms or the management of the data.*\n\n*It is important to note that any contract involving personal data should comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws, and that the dependent should be involved in the contract creation, review and termination process.*\n\n*In summary, a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier could be devised using contract law between private individuals. This contract, such as a personal data management contract, would outline the terms and conditions of how the dependent's personal and private information will be managed and protected and includes an expiration clause that specifies a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. It should also include provisions for regular reviews and dispute resolution and comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws.*\n\n*Another important aspect of this type of contract would be its enforceability. It's important to make sure that the contract is legally binding and that the rights and obligations of the parties are clearly defined and enforceable in court if needed. This can be done by including specific language in the contract that makes it clear that it is intended to be legally binding and that the parties have read and understood the terms of the contract before signing.*\n\n*Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider involving legal professionals in the drafting and review of the contract, to ensure that it meets the legal requirements and that it's terms are fair and reasonable to all parties involved.*\n\n*It's also worth noting that, in some cases the contract could be used in parallel with or as part of a legal framework that is established by the government such as a guardianship or conservatorship structure, or a legal trust. In this case, the contract would need to be aligned with and comply with the legal framework that is in place.*\n\n*In summary, a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier could be devised using contract law between private individuals, that may in-turn expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met. This type of contract, would provide clear and enforceable terms and conditions for the management and protection of the dependent's personal and private information, and would include an expiration clause that specifies a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. It should be legally binding and comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws. It's recommended to involve legal professionals in the drafting and review of the contract, to ensure that it meets the legal requirements and it's terms are fair and reasonable for all parties involved.*\n\nQ: make a list of the types of circumstances relating to a human being for whom these sorts of requirements are needed to support.\n\n1.  Children or young people who are not yet legally able to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n2.  Individuals with cognitive or developmental disabilities that impede their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n3.  Elderly individuals who are experiencing cognitive decline or have diminished capacity to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n4.  Individuals with mental illness that affects their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n5.  Individuals who are in emergency medical situations and unable to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n6.  Individuals who are incapacitated as a result of a physical or neurological injury or illness\n7.  Individuals who have a temporary or permanent loss of consciousness or brain function\n8.  Individuals who are in a state of extreme distress and unable to make decisions about their own personal and private information\n9.  Individuals who are under the care of a court-appointed guardian or conservator\n10.  Individuals who are in a long-term care facility or receiving in-home care.\n11.  Individuals who have suffered a traumatic event or have been victims of abuse, which may affect their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.\n12.  Individuals with addiction or substance abuse problems that impede their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.\n13.  Individuals who are in prison or detention centers, and may be limited in their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.\n14.  Individuals with a history of homelessness, or who are currently experiencing homelessness, and may have limited access to information management and technology.\n15.  Individuals who are living in remote or rural areas, and may have limited access to services and support that would help them manage their personal and private information.\n\nIt's important to note that, this list is not exhaustive and there may be other types of circumstances where support to manage personal and private information is needed, it's important to evaluate each situation and the needs of the person on a case by case basis.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that individuals may experience temporary or permanent changes in their abilities and require different levels of support to manage their personal and private information. The key is to work with the individual and assess their specific needs to provide the appropriate level of support and to make sure that their human rights and autonomy are respected.\n\nQ: please define an ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL SKOS, SOIC and SHACL that illustrates an example of how this might work.\n\nAn ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS, SHACL and SOIC to illustrate an example of how this might work would be a complex task, as it would involve several steps, such as identifying the classes, properties, and relationships in the domain, defining the concepts and their hierarchies, and specifying the constraints and rules that govern the data.\n\nHowever, I can provide an overview of how such an ontology might be structured, and some examples of the types of classes, properties, and relationships that would be used to represent the domain.\n\n-   RDF (Resource Description Framework) would be used to define the basic structure of the ontology, providing a way to represent resources and the relationships between them.\n    \n-   RDFS (RDF Schema) would be used to define classes and properties, and to provide a way to specify the hierarchical relationships between classes and properties.\n    \n-   OWL (Web Ontology Language) would be used to provide more advanced modeling features, such as expressing cardinality and property restrictions, and defining classes and properties as equivalent or disjoint.\n    \n-   SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) would be used to express concepts and their relationships, and to provide a way to organize and browse the concepts in the ontology.\n    \n-   SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) would be used to specify constraints and rules that govern the data, such as data types, cardinality, and allowed values.\n    \n-   SOIC (Supporting Open Identity & Control) would be used to express information related to the human identity, their rights, and access management.\n    \n\nAs an example, the ontology might include classes such as \"Dependent\", \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\", where \"Dependent\" would be a subclass of \"Person\" and \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\" would be subclasses of \"Agent\". The classes would be related through properties such as \"hasGuardian\" and \"hasDataManager\" where the properties would be defined as object properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\" respectively. The ontology would also include classes such as \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" which would be related through properties such as \"hasPersonalInformation\" and \"hasPrivacyRights\" where the properties would be defined as object properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" respectively. The ontology might also include properties such as \"accessLevel\" and \"permission\" which would be defined as data properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" respectively, to indicate the level of access and permission granted to the different parties involved.\n\nThe ontology would also include a class \"Data Management Contract\" which would be related to \"Dependent\", \"Guardian\", \"Data Manager\" and \"Personal Information\" through properties such as \"hasContract\", \"hasDependent\", \"hasGuardian\", \"hasDataManager\" and \"hasPersonalInformation\" to indicate the parties involved and the terms and conditions of the contract.\n\nIn addition, the ontology could also include classes such as \"Data Protection Law\", \"Privacy Law\" and \"Human Rights Law\" that would be related through properties such as \"compliesWith\" linking \"Data Management Contract\" with \"Data Protection Law\", \"Privacy Law\" and \"Human Rights Law\" respectively to indicate the laws that the contract must comply with.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a high level example and the details of the ontology would have to be fleshed out further, with a more detailed understanding of the domain and specific requirements. Also, the use of different vocabularies and ontologies, it is important to ensure that the ontology is consistent and coherent and that the different vocabularies and ontologies are used in a way that is consistent with their intended purpose. In addition, it is important to use established vocabularies and ontologies when they are available, to make sure that the ontology is compatible with other ontologies and can be integrated with other systems.\n\nFurthermore, one important aspect of the ontology is to make it flexible, to allow for future changes and extensions. It should be easy to update, to add new classes, properties and relationships, and to change the existing definitions as new information is acquired.\n\nIn summary, an ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS, SHACL and SOIC to illustrate an example of how the support for dependants over their personal and private information might work, would involve several steps and could make use of different vocabularies and ontologies to create a coherent and consistent model that represents the domain, while also being flexible enough to allow for future updates and extensions. The ontology would need to include classes and properties that represent the different parties involved, the personal and private information, the contract and the laws. It should also include relationships that express the connections between these different components, and constraints that ensure data accuracy and consistency, while also complying with the legal requirements.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/WorkInProgress/CognitiveAI/","title":"Cognitive AI"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Cognitive AI\n\nThis folder is intended to be developed to support the collection of considerations and inform the requirements analysis of what is required to support Cognative AI Agents in a manner that supports the HumanCentricAI requirements specifically.\n\nWhilst others may not consider this to be specifically about CognativeAI, its the best term i've found so far, to use for the general field of endevour.  \n\n## Applied Theory: Notes re: Webizen\n\nAs is otherwise noted in the document about [[SafetyConsiderations]], the use and development of Cognitive AI systems by me and related works that are specifically related to me; and the advancement of my works by others, are sought to be defined in a way that advances the tooling required to support [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]], [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI]] and related [[PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/EconomicSystems/Centricity]] considerations specifically.  Therein - These works are not sought to be employed to deploy AI Agents that act in a [[NobodyAI]] like manner / methodology; and particular protections are sought to be forged in-order to ensure that my works are not employed for those purposes.  \n\nThese objectives form constituencies to the requirements for [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].\n\n### Further Notes about Webizen\n\nHistorical works sought to produce what i called a 'knowledge banking' ecosystem methodology; which was dependant upon the useful employment of what was in-effect a belief - that organisations would want to usefully support human agency and support the fundamental requirements necessary, in-order to do so; and in-turn, gainfully benefit via the operation of infrastructure that supported those requirements.  Yet, this isn't what happened.\n\nThe commercial deployment of works, particularly those around 'Digital Identity' specifically excluded support for; what is essentially about -human right, even though, the consequence of doing so engendered what is in-effect a choice to institutionally support  [[SocialAttackVectors]].   Within these systems the 'agent' was intended to support the requirements for, what is now being illustrated as [[HumanCentricOntology]].\n\nMore information about these former 'designs' is illustrated in documents like [[TheSemanticInforg&TheHumanCentricWeb — RealityCheckTech]] that have been copied into this documetation repo.  \n\nSO, whilst motified; and subject to on-going harms by people who - i consider simply, to be bad people - i went about trying to figure out how to define this ontology, which involved engaging in debate about it with leading minds world-wide via forum focused on the science of consciousness and all sorts of weird and wonderful advanced concepts therein.  This then led to debates about issues that limited the means to form productive works in the field.\n\nAs is required to support [[FreedomofThought]] and [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI]], etc.  which in-turn led to an epiphany; which was, that the issues with `owl:thing` goes away to some-degree, if the mission is to produce a method whereby persons are made able to 'buy' (and own) their own 'robots' (ai).  By shifting from the impossible situation of having to contend with well funded adverseries who had absolutely no interest whatsoever in [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] (indeed, arguably they're seeking the opposite - whilst simultaniously seeking others to believe that they're doing so, gainfully, only because of other people); away from a persons 'digital twin', or the digital emboidment of a persons existance and all related records; towards an alternative, that was about how we define an 'ai agent' that is an emboidment of what we want to have, own and 'interact' with our lives, the situation pivoted in a fairly remarkable way.  This then led to my realisation, that this is what i needed to do with the old term 'webizen' that i had formerally used, and consequentially 'saved' webizen.org to do something good with in future.   \n\nIn the end; the Webizen, is the artificial intelligence agent that is designed to support the needs of its owner; and if the owner is a legal entity (ie: company, etc. group entity); then it must interact with other webizen, that are owned by the individuals (human beings) these systems (tools) are intended to support; as the conduit of responsibility for our biosphere.\n\nIn-order to make these 'robots' work; there needs to be a method to define 'core logic' and related systems requirements.  The development of Cognative AI ecosystem components is critical to the realisation of those goals.   \n\nWhilst Human Beings naturally develop a comprehension about many things; including natural language,\n\nRobots (software) is able to develop comprehension about many computational things.  \n\n![[differences.jpeg]]\n\nThe objective is to seek to produce personal and private AI Agents (webizen) that are equipped to support doing the tasks, that human beings are not best equipped to do. \n\nIn-effect, its a long-way down the track from the time where electronic caculators were introduced and made usable by students in schools, etc.  \n\n![[nocloud.jpg]]\n\nYet presently, the use of advanced AI generally requires interactions to be performed via 3rd party systems that are - somewhat 'global' in nature; fundamentally, these systems are not 'private' and there's an array of implications that is likely to lead some people towards seeking an alternative.  As part of these systems, seeking to provide an alternative, there needs to be some processing of complex logic in-order to support most linked requirements.\n\n## Description of CogAI \n\nCognitive artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of AI that is designed to mimic the cognitive abilities of humans, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and natural language processing. It is based on the idea that the human brain is a computational system that can be emulated by a machine, and it seeks to build AI systems that can perform tasks that require human-like cognition.\n\nCognitive AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, and machine vision, which allow machines to learn from data, understand and generate human language, and perceive and understand the visual world in a way that is similar to humans. These technologies can be applied in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, education, and customer service, to assist humans in making decisions, providing personalized recommendations, and completing tasks more efficiently.\n\nHowever, cognitive AI also raises ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for automation to displace human workers, the need for transparency and explainability in AI decision-making, and the potential for AI to perpetuate and amplify biases present in the data used to train it. As a result, the development and use of cognitive AI requires careful consideration of these issues and the responsible design and deployment of these technologies.\n\n### UseCases\n\nSome of the initial use-cases for CogAI will include the [[TheValuesProject]] and in-turn therein,  the ability to process a multitude of [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]] and in-turn provide support for Webizen Owners to evaluate whether and/or how an activity may be compliant, compatible and/or promotional of those values or whether and how there may be some sort of conflict.  \n\n### Requirements\n\nThere must be an open-standards way to perform these sorts of procedural knowledge representation tasks.  This will in-turn support productivity and reduce and/or clarify risks associated with behaviours and/or activities.\n\nThe Area has an array of very complex requirements; however fundamentally, the Web Science related requirement, is to figure out how to form a #HumanCentric Approach; so that, whilst the tools may offer suggestions and/or support, it is fundamentally still only humans that are responsible for making decisions and not Active Artificial Agents ( #AI )\n\n### W3C Cognative AI CG \n\nWork to produce an open-standard for Cognative AI is being undertaken now in the [W3C CogAI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) \n\n\"The real world is frustratingly uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent. This is challenging for traditional approaches to information systems, and a new paradigm is needed that combines symbolic and statistical techniques, building upon decades of work in the cognitive sciences, and over 500 million years of natural selection. This will allow us to create cognitive agents that learn and reason based upon prior knowledge and past experience, and which can satisfy the need for, transparency in decision making, and continuous learning for adapting to ever changing needs. This community group will address opportunities for cognitive agents using graphs, statistics, rules and graph algorithms, starting with an amalgam of RDF and Property Graphs, together with Web architecture for cognitive databases.\"\n\nSource:  [W3C CogAI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) \n\nNote also the GitHub link for the [CogAI](https://github.com/w3c/cogai/).\n\n## CogAI as a toolchain for Cognitive Databases\n\n### What are Cognative Databases?\n\n**Description by ChatGPT**\nA cognitive database is a type of database that can understand natural language queries and extract meaning from unstructured data. It uses techniques from artificial intelligence and natural language processing to analyze and understand the data stored within the database, making it more easily accessible to users. This allows for more efficient and accurate data retrieval, as well as the ability to perform more complex queries and analysis.\n\nCognitive databases can also learn and adapt over time, by analyzing user interactions and feedback to improve the accuracy of its analysis and responses. Additionally, they can provide insights and recommendations based on the data they have analyzed, and can even generate natural language responses to user queries.\n\nCognitive databases are increasingly being used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and retail, to help organizations better understand and make use of the large amounts of data they collect. They can also be used to improve customer service by allowing customers to interact with the database using natural language, rather than having to learn a specific query language.\n\nIt's important to note that cognitive databases are still relatively new and there is ongoing research to improve their capabilities and make them more widely adopted.\n\nMy Question: What is the datastructure for a cognative database?\n\nThe data structure for a cognitive database can vary depending on the specific implementation and the type of data being stored. However, some common elements include:\n\n1.  A structured data layer: This layer typically stores structured data in tables or columns, similar to a traditional relational database.\n    \n2.  An unstructured data layer: This layer is used to store unstructured data such as text, images, and audio. It can be stored in various forms such as raw text, XML, JSON and etc.\n    \n3.  A semantic layer: This layer is used to extract meaning from the unstructured data and provide a way to query it using natural language.\n    \n4.  A machine learning layer: This layer can be used to train machine learning models to understand the data and improve the accuracy of the database's analysis and responses.\n    \n5.  A knowledge graph: This layer is used to store the relationships between data entities and make it easy to traverse the data.\n    \n6.  A natural language processing (NLP) layer: This layer is used to analyze and understand natural language text, such as that found in user queries or unstructured data. It can be used to extract entities, sentiment, and intent from text and make it more easily searchable and understandable.\n    \n7.  A reasoning layer: This layer can be used to reason over the data and make inferences based on it. It can help the database understand the context of a query and provide more accurate responses.\n    \n8.  An ontology layer: This layer can be used to represent the concepts and relationships in the data using a formal ontology. This can be used to help the database understand the meaning of the data and make it more easily searchable.\n    \n9.  A visualization layer: This layer can be used to display the data in a meaningful way, such as through charts, graphs, or maps. This can make it easier for users to understand and interact with the data.\n    \n\nIt's important to note that the specific data structure of a cognitive database will depend on the particular implementation and the use case. The key feature is that it can understand and extract meaning from unstructured data, making it more easily accessible to users.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all cognitive databases will include all of these elements and the specific data structure may vary depending on the application and the specific use case.\n\nNOTES:\n\nBelow are notes that are relevant for the work described in the [[PCTOntologyModelling]] page (currently) about how to form a method for top-level ontological structures.  \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/WorkInProgress/CollectExistingOntologies/","title":"Collect Existing Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Collect Existing Ontologies\n\nExisting Ontologies are currently collected into the [webcivics/ontologies](https://github.com/webcivics/ontologies/tree/2023) repo.

As such, i've seperated this permissive commons technology documentation work from the [[Webizen]] documentation works, with the view of seeking to ensure that the approach; does not require the use of webizen specifically.\n\nYet, \n\nThere are an array of safety considerations that are being considered via the [[Webizen]] project and in-turn the  [[PCT-WebizenTechStack]] that have the effect of attending to the issues identified and considered via that process.  There is some concern about circumstances where PCT may be used without the webizen tooling, in a manner that may be harmful or form negative impacts in relation to the issues noted by the [[SocialFactors]] documents.\n\nIt should also be noted; that whilst i am cognizant of various issues that may lead to unintended and/or bad outcomes; many of these considerations relate to outcomes that may still be better than what otherwise occurs without PCT.  \n\nAs part of the applied methodology;  some consideration is being put towards establishing whether the focus should firstly be upon the applied use / application, with respect to webizen systems; and that, the ecosystems are clearly illustrated / stated / designed, with consideration about how they may be developed (through the webizen related ecosystem) to  become more useful beyond the scope of webizen users alone. \n\nPresently, the amount of resources to perform this work is miniscule by comparison to what is hoped to occur once the ecosystems are sufficiently defined as to render the means to support and be supported by; others gainfully (and morally) engaged in progressive works.\n\nYet, i cannot produce that ecosystem environment ( [See Webizen DevDocs](https://devdocs.webizen.org/) ) without implementing a permissive commons technology ecosystem, to support the informatics processes.  In-Effect, i need to create an ecosystem in-order to support the development of an ecosystem, that should in-turn render support for people whose works may provide the future capacity to address the safety (and moral) considerations related to the broad-scale use of PCT.  \n\nConversely, via means that are in-effect a form of [[SocialAttackVectors]] it is entirely likely that others will seek to 'pick the eyes out of it', to deploy similar systems, that do not share the same philophical / moral considerations; as judged by the implications of their practical actions / activities.   In most circumstances, the complexities involved in these 'ecosystems' are of a kind that results in a form of security mechanism that i've termed 'social encryption', although - have not written about in detailed specifics / specifications.  The underlying notion being, that it is very difficult to understand how these facets / constituencies all 'hang together' in a manner that i would consider to be 'correct'; as such, whilst others may well get more resources / funding / support - it is unlikely that the lifecycle of any alternatives that do not functionally support 'human rights' /  [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]] will result in failure (no ROI, etc.).\n\nAs such; the most important consideration is more purely, about ensuring whatever it is I / 'we' do - is done on a [[BestEfforts]] basis.   Anecdotally; I have been working on the general ideas over a period of time that started more than 20 years ago.  Throughout that time, there have been many who've aggressively (for gainful purposes, generally) suggested that 'they're doing it all already', or similar.  Yet, now, so many years later, so much is still not done / active.  The ideology of persons, shapes what it is they're able to create; whilst the consequences of [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI]] may not be understood by bad actors whose expertise is moreover associated with a professional capacity / expertise in gainfully carrying out [[SocialAttackVectors]] - the nature of these systems, is quite different; as such, its unlikely that they'll be able to comprehend it very well, or that they'd be equipped to design something that follows a similar set of principals that are fundamentally moral in nature.\n\nWhat is more likely to happen, is that some of the ideas that are intended to support [[FreedomofThought]] may be considered by bad actors with the express purpose of seeking to engineer systems that have the opposite effect / design / (socio) economic structures; either immediately, or as a considered pathway for future commercial growth of anysuch solutions.\n\nIrraspective of whether the lead agents are within the public or private sphere of society.\n\n## Consequence\n\nIn-order to support the embryonic stages for these technologies, it is considered that making use of a version of the webizen ecosystem; or by applying similar ecosystem considerations via web-civics, is likely to provide support services of importance; in-order to curate the development of these works so that they end-up being operationally available in a manner that supports the intended 'good' associated to the investments made to create / invent it.\n\nIf circumstances relating to these considerations change, i'll update the documentation to make a note of it. \n\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/ESG/BiosphereCalcs/","title":"Biosphere Calcs"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Biosphere Calcs\n\nThe Concept of adding the Biosphere Calcs is an attempt to consider the Biosphere related implications of a product, service or process. \n\nVarious ontologies will be used to create Machine Readable Ontologies that describe the biosphere relationships to various sorts of activities and things, which in-turn also relates to [[EnergyCalcs]], but not exclusively. \n\nThere are various [[Non-FinancialCurrencies]] related considerations that have material relationships with the relationship between agents and our biosphere.  \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/ESG/EnergyCalcs/","title":"Energy Calcs"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Energy Calcs\n\nEnergy Caculations are thought to be a critical part of the broader [[BiosphereOntologies]] although considered to be distinct from other broader [[BiosphereCalcs]], whilst still playing a vital role with [[SustainableDevelopmentGoals(ESG)]] and other related broader metrics. \n\nVarious forms of [[Non-FinancialCurrencies]], including but not limited to Carbon related metrics, fundamentally relate to the energy lifecycle costs associated to the production, consumption and an array of other factors associated to the use of things, and other broader forms of activities. \n\nTherein; the means to consider some of the broader ecosystems include methodologies that include but are not exclusive to,\n\n> 'Cradle-to-grave' assessment considers impacts at each stage of a product's life-cycle, from the time natural resources are extracted from the ground and processed through each subsequent stage of manufacturing, transportation, product use, and ultimately, disposal.\n   Source: [European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/glossary/eea-glossary/cradle-to-grave)\n\n\n> Cradle to Cradle (C2C) is about seeing garbage as an eternal resource and doing the right thing from the beginning.

While foaf:name does not explicitly represent name substructure (family vs given etc.) it does provide a basic level of interoperability. See the issue tracker for status of work on this issue.\n\nThe name property, like all RDF properties with a range of rdfs:Literal, may be used with XMLLiteral datatyped values (multiple names are acceptable whether they are in the same langauge or not). XMLLiteral usage is not yet widely adopted. Feedback on this aspect of the FOAF design is particularly welcomed.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- Label `rdfs:label`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Literal `rdfs:Literal`\n\n## title\n\n`foaf:title`\n\n```\nfoaf:title  rdf:type      rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"title\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Title (Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr. etc)\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\nThe approriate values for title are not formally constrained, and will vary across community and context. Values such as 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Ms', 'Dr' etc. are expected.\n\n## img\n\n`foaf:img`\n\n```\nfoaf:img  rdf:type          rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status      \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label          \"image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment        \"An image that can be used to represent some thing (ie. those depictions which are particularly representative of something, eg. one's photo on a homepage).\" ;\n        rdf:type            owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy    foaf: .\n```\n\nThe img property relates a Person to a Image that represents them. Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a depiction relation to any Image that depicts you, whereas img is typically used to indicate a few images that are particularly representative.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [depicts](#depicts) `foaf:depicts`\n\n## family name\n\n`foaf:familyName`\n\n```\nfoaf:familyName  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"familyName\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The family name of some person.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe familyName property is provided (alongside givenName) for use when describing parts of people's names.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property. This illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using any RDF vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification.

This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited!

One approach could be to adopt a model that places a greater emphasis on workers' rights and the fair distribution of wealth. This could involve implementing policies that aim to reduce income inequality and provide a safety net for workers who are not being fairly compensated for their labor. Additionally, there could be a focus on providing training and education opportunities to help workers develop the skills they need to negotiate for better pay and working conditions. This could be coupled with stronger labor protections and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that workers are not exploited.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that should be avoided in order to end digital slavery, including:\n\n1.  Exploitative working conditions: Employers should ensure that workers are not subjected to excessive or unreasonable workloads, and that they are provided with fair pay and benefits.\n    \n2.  Forced labor: Employers should not use threats, intimidation, or coercion to force workers to perform labor against their will.\n    \n3.  Lack of worker protections: Employers should provide workers with adequate protections, including safety equipment and training, to prevent accidents or injuries on the job.\n    \n4.  Discrimination: Employers should not discriminate against workers on the basis of their race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Employers should have policies in place to prevent and address harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace.\n    \n6.  Lack of transparency: Employers should be transparent about their labor practices and should allow workers to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nThe principles for ending digital slavery can also be applied to open-source projects done online cooperatively with others. For example, it is important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are not subjected to exploitation or forced labor. This means that they should not be asked to work excessive hours or be paid unfairly for their contributions.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are treated fairly and with respect, and that there is no discrimination or harassment. This may involve having clear policies in place to address these issues and providing a safe and inclusive environment for all contributors.\n\nTransparency is also important in open-source projects. Contributors should be aware of the terms and conditions under which they are working, and should be able to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nOverall, it is important to recognize that the contributions of open-source volunteers are valuable and should be treated with respect and fairness. By following these principles, open-source projects can be more inclusive and sustainable in the long term.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/DataPortability/","title":"Data Portability"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Data Portability\n\nData Portability is an essential requirement for various reasons.  Whilst the webizen environment is being designed to support the abiity for people to own their own 'Webizen', there are still components that need to be operated on the network, most likely via some sort of infrastructure solution that's being provided via ICT Operating in a Data Centre somewhere.  This \"Head End\" or gateway counterpart; is intended to be made available in a way that means Webizen Owners can set one up themselves.  Nonetheless, the webizen protocols feature an array of [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]] that may in-turn lead to a user wanting to migrate their entire environment to some alternative system. \n\nSo, whilst the qualities of how these systems work is very different to the way Web 2.0 apps work; there are still a series of requirements, both in seeking to obtain information from legacy systems, and also to support the needs of a user should they want to migrate.\n\nThe [Data Portability Project](https://datatransferproject.dev/) whose Current Contributors include Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, SmugMug and Twitter is an example, and the GitHub Repo for it is: [google/data-transfer-project](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project) \n\nMost other platforms have some sort of API and/or Export function, and there is a means to write software that can provide either or both; the means to transfer information to a webizen platform in future, or alterantively interact with the external platform via an API.\n\n## Solid & Similar\n\n[Solid](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) is the name of a critical foundational body of work that relates to the historical Webizen related body of works both by W3C related Communities, involving also myself (Web Civics / Trust Factory; knowledgebanking, etc) body of works. \n\nThese works also involved various other W3C Community efforts (projects); whereby the intended purpose, was to end-up with the tools required to create an ecosystem, that was supported by open-standards (w3c, ietf, etc). \n\nSolid is now led by [Inrupt](https://www.inrupt.com/) which was co-founded by the Inventor of the World-Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee,  He is presently working towards a [W3C Solid Working Group](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-solid/2022Nov/0001.html)\n\nI celebrate the significance of the attention TimBL has prioritised towards these efforts.  It was certainly the case earlier, that progress was impossible and indeed very dangerous, as such his commitment towards progressing this work; has led to progress that wouldn't have occurred otherwise.\n\nYet, For reasons i would prefer not to discuss fully publically (seems inappropriate), the Webizen Project is seemingly quite different to what it is that they've been working to create.\n\nNonetheless; part of the objectives, as to support the safety protocols requirements; should be to seek to ensure owners of webizen systems can migrate to something else that can provide the highest level of compatibility or similar features, as is possible.  This is both a moral requirement as well as it being a practical requirement. \n\nThe Webizen Ecosystems has an array of Values Frameworks, which are sought to be enforcable.  This may mean that a person who is shown to have acted in a way that invokes the need to act as to protect the rights of others in a way that is considered extremely serious; and ideally also, as should in-turn be made able to be considered by a court of law; then, the consequences may be that the [[TemporalSemantics]] are considered negative to an extent whereby the webizen owner wants to migrate away, to a system that may in-turn support different Values (ie: an environment that does not support [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]]).\n\nAs such, Whilst there are an array of very difficult considerations that need to be worked through as a [[WhatIsWebScience]] problem, the underlying belief is that the closest technical solution; is likely to be related to the [Solid Specifications](https://solidproject.org/specification) and in-turn [solid protocol](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) which needs to be supported for interoperability purposes anyway. \n\nFrom an Artificial Intelligence perspective, a means for people to migrate needs to be considered.  the options to achieve these sorts of outcomes, have not been evaluated yet.\n\nIt is expected that there will be an array of qualities that the Webizen & Web Civics Ecosystems will offer, that are not otherwise available.  Whilst it is likely that the creation of a solution will invoke a market of competitors creating similar works; it is still likely to be the case that there will be significant differences.  \n\n### 3rd Party Rights\n\nThe means to ensure that a person, regardless of their circumstances, are able to migrate; should not disaffect or cause injury to others.  This needs to be considered also, as there are various consequences that are not purely about 'data portability', but rather social informatics more broadly.  \n\n## Enforcability of Rules\n\nWhilst very best efforts are being made to seek to ensure that the environment addresses [[SocialAttackVectors]] and other threats that may otherwise cause harm to persons in a manner that is unfair; part of what is required to achieve these sorts of outcomes, is, at the end of the day - the ability for a [[TheWebizenCharter]], [[WebizenAlliance]] member to boot a person off their system and cease to provide any support or assistance for that entity.  \n\nWhilst this does not mean that a provider has any right to decide any lawful punishment that may apply to the subject of any such form of action; and whilst any judgement made by an appropriate legal tribunal and/or court of law (or indeed also via legislature); there is also an array of obligations that are built into the webizen ecosystem which require stewards (alliance charter / webizen alliance members / values-credentials related agents) to process and consequentially address.  If the consequences of those circumstances results in an outcome that means the data-subject is excommunicated; then, they still need to be provided the means to have somewhere else to go. \n\nThere are also an array of Ontological Notations that are necessarily produced, as to provide an  [[VerifiableCredentials]] that will be rendered against [[TemporalSemantics]] and ensure any disaffected parties may take any further disputes to a court of law for review and/or lawful determinations in relation to the circumstances, etc.\n\nObjectively, this is not the sort of event that is sought to occur; however, there are circumstances where the nature of a persons actions is of a kind, that requires action and most often these circumstances would also invoke a situation where reporting a matter to an appropriate law enforcement body should be part of the procedural processes employed by [[WebizenAlliance]] members.  However, it is not always the case that situations of a serious nature end-up being investigated or appropriately investigated; in which case, the consequence of on-going harms that may otherwise occur is not considered to be supportive of any factors relating to the [[Commercial Models]] including but not limited to [[ESG]] considerations, and it is important that there is a right to act; and to seek to form [[SocialFactors]] related considerations about how to address complex issues in a proportionate and responsible manner..  These sorts of works are complex and will require time and expertise of various persons, which is in-turn only reasonably able to occur after the [[Webizen 3.0]] solutions are operationally in-place.  An interim solution will be required before that occurs.\n\n### Data Formats\n\nMost of the data-systems are designed using Semantic Web technologies; or in other words, its put together using an ecosystem of open-standards in a specified manner, to create something new.  Nonetheless, the underlying data (semantic web structures, etc.) can, somewhat easily, be exported in formats that can be usefully employed by other 'apps'; but, the ecosystems solution characteristics, aren't simply about the data-format of the data only.\n\nTo Some-Degree, attempting to migrate away from the webizen environment, may become as difficult as seeking to migrate away from the use of [[Internet]] where there is no alternative that performs a similar sort of function (yet - noting the future for Blockchains, is unknown).  \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/FreedomofThought/","title":"Freedom of Thought"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Freedom of Thought\n\nFreedom of thought is the freedom of an individual to hold or consider a fact, opinion, or belief without interference or coercion. It is a fundamental human right that is protected by various national and international laws and agreements, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Freedom of thought allows people to form and express their own beliefs and opinions, and to think and speak freely without fear of reprisal or punishment. It is an essential element of a free and democratic society, as it enables individuals to engage in critical thinking, debate, and the free exchange of ideas. Freedom of thought is often closely connected to other fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press.\n\nThere are a few key measures that are typically required to protect freedom of thought:\n\n1.  Legal protections: Freedom of thought is often protected by national and international laws and agreements that prohibit interference with an individual's right to hold and express their own beliefs and opinions.\n    \n2.  Political will: Governments and other authorities must be committed to protecting freedom of thought and be willing to take action to defend it when it is threatened.\n    \n3.  A robust civil society: A strong and active civil society, including media, NGOs, and other organizations, can help to promote and defend freedom of thought by advocating for the rights of individuals and holding authorities accountable.\n    \n4.  An informed and educated public: An informed and educated public is more likely to support and defend freedom of thought, as they are better equipped to understand the importance of this right and to recognize when it is being threatened.\n    \n5.  A culture of respect and tolerance: A culture that values diversity of thought and encourages respectful dialogue and debate can also help to protect freedom of thought.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that can threaten freedom of thought, including:\n\n1.  Censorship: Governments or other authorities may try to suppress certain ideas or beliefs by censoring information or punishing those who express certain viewpoints.\n    \n2.  Intimidation: Threats, harassment, or violence against those who hold or express certain beliefs can deter people from thinking or speaking freely.\n    \n3.  Propaganda: The use of misleading or biased information to manipulate public opinion or shape people's beliefs can undermine freedom of thought.\n    \n4.  Groupthink: Pressure to conform to the beliefs or opinions of a particular group can discourage independent thought and limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives.\n    \n5.  Lack of access to information: If people do not have access to a wide range of viewpoints and sources of information, they may be limited in their ability to think freely and form their own opinions.\n\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/FairWorkProtocols/","title":"Fair Work Protocols"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Fair Work Protocols\n\nThe Development of Fair Work Protocols, is an essential component to producing any solution that has any capacity whatsoever for [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].\n\nThe Considerations relate to a problem that is fundamentally very old, and indeed also quite complex.  In consideration, a lens of considering the past - in particular, the 8 hour movement and related historical contexts are thought useful when considering how a means to address these sorts of complex problems, might be addressed. \n\n### About the 8-Hour Movement\nThe [8-hour movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day) was a labor movement that sought to improve working conditions and protect the rights of workers by advocating for the reduction of the workday to 8 hours. The movement emerged in the late 19th century, at a time when many workers were subjected to long and grueling workdays, often working 12 hours or more per day.\n\nThe 8-hour movement argued that reducing the workday to 8 hours would improve the health and well-being of workers, as well as increase productivity and efficiency. The movement used a variety of tactics to promote its goals, including strikes, boycotts, and lobbying efforts.\n\nThe 8-hour movement was successful in achieving many of its goals. In many countries, labor laws were enacted that set limits on the length of the workday and established the right to overtime pay for work beyond 8 hours per day. In the United States, the 8-hour movement played a key role in the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the 40-hour workweek and established the right to overtime pay for work beyond 40 hours per week.\n\nOverall, the 8-hour movement was a significant force in the fight for workers' rights and helped to improve the working conditions and well-being of millions of workers around the world.\n\nActivities that are a form of work are those that are performed for the purpose of earning a living or producing goods or services. These activities may involve physical or mental labor and may be performed for an employer or as self-employment. Examples of work activities include:\n\n1.  Manufacturing goods\n2.  Providing services, such as consulting or healthcare\n3.  Teaching or lecturing\n4.  Performing research\n5.  Writing or creating content\n6.  Sales or marketing\n7.  Managing a business\n\nWork activities are typically distinguished from recreation and sleep activities in that they are undertaken for the purpose of earning a living or producing goods or services, rather than for leisure or relaxation. However, it is important to note that what is considered work may vary depending on cultural and societal context, and some activities that are considered work in one context may be considered recreation in another.\n\nThe principles of the 8-hour movement, which sought to improve working conditions and protect the rights of workers in the industrial era, can be rejuvenated and applied to knowledge work in a number of ways. Some potential approaches could include:\n\n1.  Adjusting the focus: Rather than focusing solely on the number of hours worked, the principles of the 8-hour movement could be adapted to address issues specific to knowledge work, such as the need for flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance.\n    \n2.  Strengthening worker protections: Knowledge workers may not have the same level of legal protections as traditional workers, such as the right to unionize or the protection of labor laws. Policymakers and advocacy groups could work to strengthen protections for knowledge workers, such as by establishing new regulations or extending existing protections to cover this group.\n    \n3.  Promoting fair compensation: Knowledge work can often be highly skilled and specialized, and knowledge workers may be entitled to fair compensation for their contributions. Advocacy groups and policymakers could work to promote fair compensation for knowledge work, such as by establishing guidelines or standards for fair pay.\n    \n4.  Supporting education and training: The principles of the 8-hour movement could also be rejuvenated by supporting education and training programs that help knowledge workers to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their careers. This could include initiatives to promote lifelong learning and provide access to educational opportunities for knowledge workers.\n    \n\n### Forming an applied Methodology for Knowledge Workers\nThere are many ways that the principles of the 8-hour movement could be rejuvenated and applied to knowledge work in order to support the rights and well-being of knowledge workers. By adjusting the focus to address the specific needs of knowledge workers, strengthening worker protections, promoting fair compensation, and supporting education and training, it is possible to create a more supportive and fair environment for knowledge work. This can help to ensure that knowledge workers are able to contribute their skills and expertise to society, while also being able to enjoy a high quality of life and work-life balance.\n\nThe nature of the concept of time spent engaged in work, recreation, and sleep activities for knowledge workers may differ from that of traditional workers in a number of ways. Some potential differences could include:\n\n1.  Flexibility: Knowledge work often requires a high level of flexibility, as knowledge workers may need to be able to adapt to changing demands and priorities. This may involve working outside of traditional business hours or working from different locations.\n    \n2.  Autonomy: Knowledge workers may also have a higher level of autonomy, as they may be responsible for managing their own work schedules and priorities. This can allow for greater control over the balance between work, recreation, and sleep activities.\n    \n3.  Boundaries: The boundaries between work, recreation, and sleep may be less clear for knowledge workers, as they may be required to be available and responsive to work-related demands outside of traditional business hours. This can make it more difficult to maintain a healthy balance between these activities.\n    \n\nThe nature of the concept of time spent engaged in work, recreation, and sleep activities for knowledge workers may be more flexible and autonomous than for traditional workers, but it may also involve a greater challenge in maintaining a healthy balance between these activities.\n\nPaying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their time spent doing work is important for a number of reasons:\n\n1.  Fair compensation: Knowledge work can often be highly skilled and specialized, and knowledge workers may be entitled to fair compensation for their contributions. Paying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their work can help to ensure that they are fairly compensated for their efforts and expertise.\n    \n2.  Motivation and retention: Fair compensation can also be important for motivating and retaining knowledge workers. If knowledge workers feel that they are not being fairly compensated for their work, they may be less motivated to perform at their best or may be more likely to leave for other opportunities.\n    \n3.  Intellectual property rights: Payment can also help to respect the intellectual property rights of knowledge workers. If knowledge workers are not compensated for their useful works, they may not have the financial resources to enforce their intellectual property rights or may be less likely to assert their rights in the face of potential exploitation.\n    \n\n#### Building an Equitable Future for Creators\n\nPaying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their work is important for ensuring that they are fairly compensated, motivated, and able to assert their intellectual property rights. This can help to create a more supportive and fair environment for knowledge work, which can benefit both knowledge workers and society as a whole.\n\nIncome is often closely related to a person's ability to keep themselves safe, as having a steady and sufficient source of income can provide access to a range of resources and protections that can help to ensure safety and security.\n\nFor example, having a sufficient income can allow a person to afford basic necessities such as food, shelter, and medical care, which can help to ensure physical safety and well-being. Income can also provide access to financial resources that can be used to protect against financial risks, such as the ability to afford insurance or save for emergencies.\n\nIn addition, income can often be used to purchase goods and services that can help to ensure safety, such as security systems or emergency services. Having a sufficient income can also allow a person to afford legal representation or other forms of advocacy, which can be important for protecting their rights and interests.\n\nincome is often closely related to a person's ability to keep themselves safe, as it provides access to a range of resources and protections that can help to ensure safety and security.\n\n\n### Relationship to Web Science Tasks\n\nThere are a number of web science questions that could be investigated in order to support the development of fair work protocols for knowledge workers. Some potential areas of investigation could include:\n\n1.  Workflow and productivity: Web science research could explore how different workflows and technologies impact the productivity and well-being of knowledge workers. This could include studying the effects of remote work, flexible work schedules, and collaborative tools on worker outcomes.\n    \n2.  Fair compensation: Web science research could also examine how to design fair compensation systems for knowledge workers, including exploring the use of algorithms and other tools to assess the value of different types of knowledge work.\n    \n3.  Intellectual property rights: Web science research could also explore ways to protect the intellectual property rights of knowledge workers, including studying the effectiveness of different approaches to licensing and copyright.\n    \n4.  Work-life balance: Web science research could examine how to support work-life balance for knowledge workers, including studying the impact of different work environments and policies on worker well-being.\n    \n\nThere are many different web science questions that could be investigated in order to support the development of fair work protocols for knowledge workers. By studying these issues, web science can help to inform the design of policies and practices that support the rights and well-being of knowledge workers.\n\n### ESG Implications \n[[ESG]] (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria can be related to the importance of developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers in a number of ways. For example:\n\n1.  Social criteria: Developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers could be considered a social issue, as it relates to the well-being and rights of workers. Ensuring that knowledge workers are treated fairly and are able to work in a supportive and healthy environment could be seen as a key element of a company's social responsibility.\n    \n2.  Governance criteria: Fair work protocols can also be related to governance criteria, as they can help to ensure that a company is governed in a transparent and accountable manner. Developing and implementing fair work protocols can help to demonstrate a company's commitment to responsible and ethical business practices.\n    \n\nOverall, ESG criteria can be related to the importance of developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers in that they can help to ensure that companies are addressing key social and governance issues and are committed to responsible and ethical business practices. By considering ESG criteria in the development of fair work protocols, companies can help to ensure that they are contributing to a more sustainable and equitable society."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricDigitalIdentity/","title":"HumanCentric Digital Identity"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# HumanCentric Digital Identity\n\nThis is intended to be a brief summary document providing some sense about the complexities involved in designing systems to support Human [identity development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_formation) and/or #HumanIdentity support systems, as is distinct to the use of the term #Identity or #DigitalIdentity in most (other) contexts.\n\nThis is not intended to be an exhaustive document on the topic. \n\nThe top Google definition of what 'identity', defines the concept as: *the fact of being who or what a person or thing is.* Yet this is not what most persons speaking about the concept from a perspective of their work or employer mean (note: [[SocialFactors]]).  Most of the time what these people are talking about is some sort of identity related instrument or what Americans call 'Credentials'.   In some circumstances, particularly within the field of #ICT #Cyber and #Internet what they're talking about is the way people 'log in', and in fields relating to finance they often mean the ability to verify their services are connected to a known entity for legal purposes such as anti-money laundering laws ( #KYCAML ) and similar; and whilst these constituencies relating to persons are very important, they're different to 'human identity' and have both different qualities and different sorts of needs.  \n\nThe Webizen Approach to better rationalising the concept of 'human identity' is a critically important foundational requirement for the entire ecosystem. As such, it is an instrumental part of the [[SafetyProtocols]] framework.   Essentially, what the webizen environment does is provides a capacity for software agents to semantically and temporally support agent centric communications and personal stewardship of a persons own life, and therefore / thereby - their #Identity. \n\nThese concepts are somewhat linked with the [[PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/EconomicSystems/Centricity]] considerations that are part of the informatics design principals.  Therein, whilst 3rd parties will provide [[VerifiableCredentials]] they do not in and of themselves define who a human being is; they only provide artifacts related to that instrument and whatever it is says, only reflects the statements made on that verifiable document; it does not in and of itself, define a human being; nor does any private key related to the storage of that #Thing.   The greatest reason why others cannot properly define a person in a way that appropriately defines exactly who that person is; is that, they'd need to know everything about that person, which is not possible for various scientific reasons.  \n\nSo, there's a concept of #Observers which is in-turn dynamic with [[TemporalSemantics]] and what is in-effect a subset of [[PermissiveCommons]]. \n\nIn-effect, the #Webizen environment is intended to provide support for #HumanIdentity in a particular way, that means the person is responsible for defining who it is they are, as a consequence of their actions - of what they do, what they don't do, etc.  \n\nThis is then stored in a way that provides the owner of a #Webizen to manage their identity and in-turn also, their [[Relationships(Social)]].  These considerations are being assembled into useful tools that seek to have the effect of protecting  [[FreedomofThought]] and in-turn also address issues of significance, such as [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].  To achieve this, foundational requirements such as [[TheValuesProject]] works to create an #AI environment that is able to support complex technology related requirements.  \n\nIn-turn, these systems are intended to support a methodology where Webizen Owners, have the tools they need to be the primary steward of their own lives, and in-turn support also the means for those persons to both; protect themselves and their loved ones (including children & other dependants) from harms that the architecture of how information systems work today, enable and in-turn provide economic support for both enabling and processing [[Currencies]] gainfully by exploiters, at great cost.\n\nEarlier documents about this include; but are not exclusive to,\n\nThe 2018 webizen.net.au files; \n- [[social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles]] \n- [[socioeconomic-relations-p1]]\n- [[personal-augmentation-of-ai]]\n- [[preserving-the-freedom-to-think]]\n- [[Social Encryption An Introduction]]\n\n(note there are more in that library)\n\n(others to be added soon).\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/NoLock-ins/","title":"No Lock-ins"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# No Lock-ins\n\nThere area variety of unwanted behaviours, that are often commercially motivated, that engender some form of lock-in that is contrary to the interests of [[TheValuesProject]] and in-turn also, [[TheWebizenCharter]], [[WebizenAlliance]] and other related considerations.\n\nIn-order to support a means to maintain the hygiene of these environments and the underlying moral integrity of the broader objective, [[DataPortability]]  is being designed as one of the [[SafetyProtocols]]. \n\nOthers include;\n\n## Golden Handcuffs\nI've been using the term 'golden handcuffs' for sometime, and only recently reviewed the definition provided for the Concept [Golden Handcuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs), finding that the meaning was in many ways different to what it was i was trying to describe.

This typically requires the prosecution to present evidence that demonstrates the elements of the crime, such as the act or conduct that constituted the crime, the intent or state of mind of the accused, and any attendant circumstances.\n\nIn criminal cases, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. This means that the prosecution must present evidence that is sufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence and to persuade the jury or judge that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIf the prosecution is able to meet this burden of proof, the accused may be found guilty of the crime. If the prosecution is unable to meet this burden of proof, the accused may be found not guilty or the case may be dismissed.\n\nOverall, the legal standard for finding someone guilty of a crime is high, and it is designed to ensure that individuals are not wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit.\n\nThere are several procedural requirements that must be followed in order to address an issue of criminal wrongdoing online, particularly if the account being used is not easily associated with the legal person using it. Some of the key steps that may be involved in this process include:\n\n1.  Investigation: The first step in addressing an issue of criminal wrongdoing online is typically to conduct an investigation. This may involve collecting and analyzing evidence, such as electronic records and documents, to determine the nature and extent of the wrongdoing.\n    \n2.  Identification of suspects: If the investigation reveals that a crime has been committed, the next step is typically to identify the suspects involved. This may involve using forensic techniques to trace the IP address of the account being used or to identify any other identifying information that may be associated with the account.\n    \n3.  Arrest and charging: If the suspects are identified and there is sufficient evidence to support charges, the next step is typically to arrest the suspects and charge them with the appropriate crimes.\n    \n4.  Pre-trial proceedings: Once the suspects have been charged, the case will typically proceed to pre-trial proceedings, which may include plea negotiations, motions, and other legal proceedings.\n    \n5.  Trial: If the case is not resolved through pre-trial proceedings, it will typically proceed to trial, where the prosecution will present its case and the defense will present its case.\n    \n6.  Verdict and sentencing: If the suspects are found guilty, the court will typically impose a sentence, which may include imprisonment, fines, or other penalties.\n    \n\nOverall, the process of addressing an issue of criminal wrongdoing online can be complex and time-consuming, and it requires the involvement of law enforcement agencies and legal professionals.

As we leave the former world of broadcast services where the considerations of propaganda were far better understood; to more modern services that serve not millions, but billions of humans across the planet, the principles we forged as communities seem to need to be re-established.  We have the precedents of Humans Rights, but do not know how to apply them in a world where the ‘choice of law’ for the websites we use to communicate, may deem us to be alien.  Traditionally these problems were solved via the application of Liberal Arts, however through the advent of the web, the more modern context becomes that of Web Science incorporating the role of ‘philosophical engineering’ (and therein the considerations of liberal arts via computer scientists).\n\nSo what are our principle, what are our shared values? And how do we build a ‘web we want’ that makes our world a better place both now, and into the future? \n\nIt seems many throughout the world have suffered mental health issues as a result of the recent election result in the USA.  A moment in time where seemingly billions of people have simultaneously highlighted a perceived issue where the results of a populous exacting their democratic rights resulted in global issues that pertained to the outcome being a significant surprise.   So perhaps the baseline question becomes; how will our web better provide the means in which to provide us (humans) a more accurate understanding of world-events and circumstances felt by humans, via our ‘world wide web’.\n\n**# Linked-Data, Ontologies and Verifiable Claims  \n\nBy:  [@Ubiquitous](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous) \n  \nLinked-Data is a technology that produces machine and human readable information that is embedded in webpages.  Linked-Data powers many of the online experiences we use today, with a vast array of the web made available in these machine-readable formats.  The scope of linked-data use, even within the public sphere, is rather enormous.\n\nRight now, most websites are using ‘linked data’ to ensure their news is being presented correctly on Facebook and via search, which is primarily supported via [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) .\n\nThe first problem is: that these ontologies do not support concepts such as genre.  This means in-turn that rather than ‘news’ becoming classified, as it would in any ordinary library or newspaper, the way in which ‘news’ is presented in a machine-readable format is particularly narrow and without (machine readable) context. \n\nThis means, in-turn, that the ability for content publishers to self-identify whether their article is an ‘advertorial’, ‘factual’, ‘satire’, ‘entertainment’ or other form of creative work - is not currently available in a machine-readable context. \n\nThis is kind of similar to the lack of ‘emotions’ provided by ‘social network silos’ to understand ‘sentiment analysis’ through semantic tooling that offer means to profile environments and offer tooling for organisations.  Whilst Facebook offers the means to moderate particular words for its pages product this functionality is not currently available to humans (account holders).  \n\nThe mixture of a lack of available markup language for classifying posts, alongside the technical capabilities available to ‘persona ficta’ in a manner that is not similarly available to Humans, contributes towards the lack of ‘human centric’ functionality these platforms currently exhibit. \n\n### Bad Actors and Fact-Checking\n\nIn dealing with the second problem (In association to the use of Linked-Data), the means in which to verify claims is available through the application of ‘credentials’ or Verifiable Claims which in-turn relates to the Open Badges Spec.  \n\nThese solutions allow an actor to gain verification from 3rd parties to provide their audience greater confidence that the claims represented by their articles.  Whether it is the means to “fact check” words, ensure images have not been ‘photoshopped’ or other ‘verification tasks’, one or more reputable sources could use verifiable claims to in-turn support end-user (reader / human) to gain confidence in what has been published.  Pragmatically, this can either be done locally or via the web through 3rd parties through the use of Linked-Data.  For more information, get involved in W3C, you’ll find almost every significant organisation involved with Web Technology debating how to build standard to define the web we want.\n\n  \n### General (re: Linked Data)\n\nIf you would like to review the machine-readable markup embedded in the web you enjoy today, one of the means to do so is via the Openlink Data Sniffer  An innovative concept for representing information was produced by Ted Nelson via his Xanadu Concept\n\nAdvancements in Computing Technology may make it difficult to trust media-sources in an environment that seemingly has difficulty understanding the human-centric foundations to our world; and, where the issues highlighted by many, including Eben Moglen, continue to grow.  Regardless of the technical means we have to analyse content, it will always be important that we consider virtues such as kindness; and, it is important that those who represent us, put these sorts of issues on the agenda in which “fake news” has become yet another example (or symptom) of a much broader problem (imho).  \n  \n\nA simple (additional) example of how a ‘graph database’ works as illustrated by this DbPedia example.  The production of “web 3.0” is remarkably different to former versions due to the volume of pre-existing web-users.  Whilst studies have shown that humans are not really that different, the challenge becomes how to fund the development costs of works that are not commercially focused (ie: in the interests of ‘persona ficta’) in the short-term, and to challenge issues such as ‘fake news’ or indeed also even, how to find a ‘Toilets’.  As ‘human centric’ needs continue to be unsupported via the web or indeed also, the emerging intelligent assistants working upon the same datasets; the problem technologists have broadly produced becomes that of a world produced for things that ‘sell’, without support for things we value. Whether it be support for how to help vulnerable people, receipts that don’t fade (ie: not thermal, but rather machine-readable), civic services, the means to use data to uphold ‘rule of law’, vote and participate in civics or the array of other examples in which we have the technology, but not the accessible application in which to apply the use of our technology to social/human needs.  \n\nIndeed the works we produce and contribute on the web are for the most-part provided not simply freely, but at our own cost.   The things that are ‘human’ are less important and indeed, poorly supported.**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SocialAttackVectors/PublicSectorWrongDoings/","title":"Public Sector Wrong Doings"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Public Sector Wrong Doings\n\n*Chat GPT:*\n\nPublic sector crimes are illegal or unethical activities that are committed by individuals or organizations working in the public sector, such as government departments or agencies, critical public sector entities like police or social security offices, or parliamentary offices.\n\nSome examples of public sector crimes include:\n\n-   Corruption: This can include activities such as accepting or offering bribes, embezzling public funds, or using public office for personal gain.\n    \n-   Fraud: This can include activities such as making false or misleading statements in order to obtain public funds or benefits, or using false or misleading information to obtain contracts or tenders.\n    \n-   Misuse of public resources: This can include activities such as using public resources for personal gain or for activities that are not related to the official duties of the organization.\n    \n-   Insider trading: This can refer to the use of non-public information about a government agency or public sector entity to make trades or investments.\n    \n-   Health and safety violations: This can include activities such as failing to provide a safe work environment or ignoring safety regulations, particularly in the context of critical public sector entities like police or social security offices.\n\nPublic sector crimes can have serious consequences for the individuals and organizations involved, as well as for society as a whole. They can undermine trust in public institutions and systems, damage reputations, and result in significant financial losses. It is important for public sector organizations and individuals to be aware of the risks of public sector crimes and to take steps to prevent and detect them, such as by implementing strong internal controls and compliance programs and training employees on ethical business practices.\n\nSome other examples of public sector crimes include:\n\n-   Misuse of power: This can refer to the abuse of authority or position in order to gain an unfair advantage or to engage in activities that are not in the public interest.\n    \n-   Discrimination: This can refer to the act of treating someone unfairly or unfairly denying them access to resources or opportunities based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, or other protected characteristic.\n    \n-   Bribery: This can refer to the act of offering or accepting bribes in order to gain an unfair advantage or to influence the actions of a public sector entity or individual.\n    \n-   Violation of privacy: This can refer to the unauthorized collection, use, or disclosure of personal information, particularly in the context of critical public sector entities like police or social security offices.\n    \n-   Misuse of confidential information: This can refer to the unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, such as trade secrets or sensitive government documents.\n\nOverall, public sector crimes can take many forms and can have serious consequences for the individuals and organizations involved, as well as for society as a whole. It is important for public sector organizations and individuals to be aware of the risks and to take steps to prevent and detect these types of crimes.\n\n> *Define Malfesence?*\n\nMalfeasance refers to the act of performing a legally or ethically wrong or improper act, particularly while in a position of trust or authority. It is often used in the context of public officials or employees who abuse their power or position for personal or financial gain, or to engage in activities that are not in the public interest.\n\nExamples of malfeasance can include activities such as embezzlement, bribery, fraud, misuse of public resources, and abuse of power. Malfeasance can have serious consequences for both the individuals and organizations involved, as it can undermine trust in public institutions and systems and result in significant financial losses.\n\nIt is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the risks of malfeasance and to take steps to prevent and detect it. This can include implementing strong internal controls and compliance programs, training employees on ethical business practices, and holding individuals accountable for their actions.\n\n> *Questions re: Probity*\n\nProbity refers to the quality of being honest, upright, and morally correct. It is often used in the context of public officials or employees who are expected to adhere to high standards of integrity and ethical conduct in their roles.\n\nProbity is an important concept in public life, as it is essential for maintaining trust in public institutions and systems. Public officials and employees who demonstrate probity are seen as trustworthy and reliable, and they are more likely to be respected and trusted by the public.\n\nProbity can be demonstrated through a number of behaviors, such as honesty, transparency, fairness, and accountability. It is important for individuals and organizations to uphold high standards of probity in order to maintain public trust and confidence. This can involve implementing strong internal controls and compliance programs, training employees on ethical business practices, and holding individuals accountable for their actions.\n\nThe opposite of probity is impropriety, which refers to the act of behaving in an improper or unethical manner, particularly while in a position of trust or authority. Impropriety can take many forms, such as corruption, abuse of power, or engaging in activities that are not in the public interest.\n\nImpropriety can have serious consequences for both the individuals and organizations involved, as it can undermine trust in public institutions and systems and result in significant financial losses. It is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the risks of impropriety and to take steps to prevent and detect it, such as by implementing strong internal controls and compliance programs and training employees on ethical business practices.\n\n> *Whats it called if a person is sought to be compelled to not tell the truth and/or cover up wrong-doing that has previously occurred by one or more persons (ie: government employees) who infer and/or suggest that the person will not be provided any further governmental assistance or be considered for any grants or forms of support, if they speak about something that government has done that has caused them harm and/or serious injury?*\n\nIf a person is sought to be compelled to not tell the truth and/or cover up wrongdoing that has previously occurred by one or more persons (e.g., government employees) who infer and/or suggest that the person will not be provided any further governmental assistance or be considered for any grants or forms of support if they speak about something that the government has done that has caused them harm and/or serious injury, this could be considered witness tampering.\n\nWitness tampering is a crime that involves attempting to influence, intimidate, or coerce a witness in order to prevent them from telling the truth or to influence their testimony. It is often used to obstruct justice or to interfere with legal proceedings.\n\nWitness tampering can take many forms, such as threatening or intimidating a witness, offering a witness a bribe or other inducement to not testify or to testify falsely, or withholding or destroying evidence. It is illegal and can result in criminal charges and severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines.\n\nOverall, it is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the risks of witness tampering and to take steps to prevent and detect it. This can include implementing strong internal controls and compliance programs, training employees on ethical business practices, and holding individuals accountable for their actions.\n\nIn addition to witness tampering, there are other terms that might be used to describe the sort of wrongdoing you described, such as:\n\n-   Obstruction of justice: This refers to the act of interfering with the administration of justice or the investigation or prosecution of a crime. It can include activities such as tampering with evidence, hindering an investigation, or influencing a witness.\n    \n-   Bribery: This refers to the act of offering or accepting a bribe in order to influence the actions or decisions of another person. It can include activities such as offering a reward or inducement to a witness to not testify or to testify falsely.\n    \n-   Intimidation: This refers to the act of threatening or coercing another person in order to influence their actions or decisions. It can include activities such as threatening a witness to not testify or to testify falsely.\n    \n-   Fraud: This refers to the act of intentionally deceiving or misleading someone in order to gain an advantage or benefit. It can include activities such as making false or misleading statements to a witness in order to influence their testimony.\n    \n\nOverall, these types of wrongdoing can have serious consequences for both the individuals and organizations involved, as they can undermine trust in public institutions and systems and result in significant financial losses. It is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the risks of these types of wrongdoing and to take steps to prevent and detect them. This can include implementing strong internal controls and compliance programs, training employees on ethical business practices, and holding individuals accountable for their actions.\n\n\n***TO BE CONTINUED...***"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SocialAttackVectors/TemporalAttacks/","title":"Temporal Attacks"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Temporal Attacks\n\nThere are many different types of temporal attacks, one of the ones that cause me upset is the one that's about a person, often representing an entity (often a entity of public trust); that *'they're doing it all already'*.  \n\nThe other is the one that's about a person who may be scouting for opportunities and in-order to diminish a person presenting the work that they've done (and any value or cost that may be attributed to that work); they focus on what hasn't been done, making the inference that nothing they've done is useful unless they continue to produce more work to produce more output; and this behaviour is in-turn cyclical, it doesn't actually matter how much work a person has done - the temporal attack is a form of abuse.\n\nOther temporal attacks include;\n1. Changing the content of an electronic record / document, to change the statements that were made earlier - without acknowledging that any changes were at all made.\n   \n2. Gamification; Often via groups of persons, a commercial attack that is intended to ensure the target is unable to do anything about a series of behaviours that intend to cause harm and/or immoblisation; in-order for the attacker to gain advantage and/or successfully achieve an outcome that was originally the work of the victim of this sort of attack, but is later misappropriated elsewhere - at which stage, there is no legal remedy that is able to resolve the harms caused to the victim of the attacks.  These behaviours in-turn relate to obstruction and other issues relating to both civil and criminal matters of concern.\n   \n3. Removal of records; the deletion of evidence relating to wrong-doing for the purpose of making the claim that the wrong-doing was never done at all. \n   \n4. Versioning: whilst there's various forms of it, the underlying notion is that a group of people (often unpaid) start a body of work, which is later progressed by others who may be employed and their employers (or investors) see the merit of the works; then as future works are produced, they act to version-out the original creators, making it impossible to see the history of how something came about; and in-turn also, the relationships to whomever was involved at a time earlier to the commercialisation of derivatives froma project.\n\nMore to come.  \n\nNB: the underlying method to address this problem is via support for [[TemporalSemantics]].\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/HostServiceRequirements/Authentication Fabric/","title":"Authentication Fabric"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"(incomplete - to be updated)\nThe Authentication Fabric is complicated and involves many parts, that are intended to work as an ecosystem.  \n\nThe effect of the Authentication Fabric is intended to result in a curatable, highly secure & accountability 'fabric' with attribute based access control; that becomes managable via the query interface (alongside more manual interfaces). \n\nThere's a couple of different layers involved in this Authentication Fabric.\n\n### Authentication of Devices\nA variety of host-fingerprinting information is employed and thereafter supported via [WebIDSpecifications](WebIDSpecifications.md) [WebID-TLS](Semantic%20Web/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS.md), [WebID-TLS](Semantic%20Web/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS.md) and similar.  \n\nNB: https://github.com/jaypipes/ghw\n \n### Network Authentication tooling\nThe \"Network\" Authentication fabric makes use of IPv4/IPv6 (preferred) tooling, alongside DNS, TLS, [VerifiableCredentials](VerifiableCredentials.md) and [WebID-OIDC](Semantic%20Web/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-OIDC.md)\n\n### Agent Authentication Tooling\nAgent based authentication links with the semantic authentication chain, alongside [WebID-OIDC](Semantic%20Web/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-OIDC.md) and [VerifiableCredentials](VerifiableCredentials.md) alongside tools such as [WebAuthn](Webizen%20Tech%20Stack/Webizen%203.0/Webizen%20App%20Spec/WebSpec/WebPlatformTools/WebAuthn.md). \n\nNOTE\nThis document is incomplete.

While criminal law aims to punish individuals who commit crimes, tort law aims to compensate individuals who suffer harm as a result of the actions of others.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-:2-2)[a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-4) Some wrongful acts, such as [assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault \"Assault\") and [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime) \"Battery (crime)\"), can result in both a civil lawsuit and a criminal prosecution in countries where the civil and criminal legal systems are separate. Tort law may also be contrasted with [contract law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_law \"Contract law\"), which provides civil remedies after breach of a duty that arises from a contract. Obligations in both tort and criminal law are more fundamental and are imposed regardless of whether the parties have a contract.\n\nWhile tort law in [civil law jurisdictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system) \"Civil law (legal system)\") largely derives from [Roman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law \"Roman law\"), [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\") jurisdictions derive their tort law from customary [English tort law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_tort_law \"English tort law\"). In civil law jurisdictions based on civil codes, both contractual and tortious or delictual liability is typically outlined in a civil code based on Roman Law principles. Tort law is referred to as the law of delict in [Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law \"Scots law\") and [Roman Dutch law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman-Dutch_law \"Roman-Dutch law\"), and resembles tort law in common law jurisdictions in that rules regarding civil liability are established primarily by precedent and theory rather than an exhaustive code. However, like other civil law jurisdictions, the underlying principles are drawn from Roman law. A handful of jurisdictions have codified a mixture of common and civil law jurisprudence either due to their colonial past (e.g. Québec, St Lucia, Mauritius) or due to influence from multiple legal traditions when their civil codes were drafted (e.g. Mainland China, the Philippines, and Thailand). Furthermore, Israel essentially codifies common law provisions on tort.\n\n\n## Outline of tort law\n\n[Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_tort_law)\n\nThe following [outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list) \"Outline (list)\") is provided as an overview of and introduction to tort law in [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\") jurisdictions:\n\n**[Tort law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_law \"Tort law\")** – defines what a legal injury is and, therefore, whether a person may be held liable for an injury they have caused. Legal injuries are not limited to physical injuries. They may also include emotional, economic, or reputational injuries as well as violations of privacy, property, or constitutional rights.\n\n### Torts against the person\n\n[Torts (trespass) against the person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_against_the_person \"Trespass against the person\") – category of torts that describes a civil wrong that causes physical harm to the complainant:\n\n-   [Assault (tort)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_(tort) \"Assault (tort)\") – intentionally and voluntarily causing the reasonable apprehension of an immediate harmful or offensive contact.\n-   [Battery (tort)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(tort) \"Battery (tort)\") – Bringing about an unconsentful harmful or offensive contact with a person or to something closely associated with that person (such as an item of clothing). It differs from assault in that it requires actual contact.\n-   [False imprisonment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_imprisonment \"False imprisonment\") – A person is intentionally confined without legal authority.\n-   [Intentional infliction of emotional distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress \"Intentional infliction of emotional distress\") – Intentional conduct that results in extreme emotional distress.\n\n### Negligent torts\n\n[Negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence \"Negligence\") – failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances\n\n-   [Breach of duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence#Breach_of_duty \"Negligence\") – There can be no liability in negligence unless the claimant established that he or she was owed a [duty of care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care \"Duty of care\") by the defendant and that there has been a breach of that duty.\n-   [Legal causation or remoteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence#Legal_causation_or_remoteness \"Negligence\") – The idea that liability may be so remote from the defendant that the negligence was not foreseeable or preventable by that party.\n-   [Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligent_infliction_of_emotional_distress \"Negligent infliction of emotional distress\") - The idea that one has a [legal duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care \"Duty of care\") to use reasonable care to avoid causing [emotional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion \"Emotion\") [distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(medicine) \"Stress (medicine)\") to another individual.\n-   [Malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malpractice \"Malpractice\") or [professional negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_negligence \"Professional negligence\") – Negligence in the provision of a professional service causing harm to the claimant. Common varieties include [medical malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice \"Medical malpractice\") and [legal malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_malpractice \"Legal malpractice\")\n-   [Negligence _per se_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence_per_se \"Negligence per se\") – Conduct which by its very nature gives rise to a presumption of negligence.\n\n### Property torts\n\n-   [Trespass to land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_to_land \"Trespass to land\") – Committed when an individual intentionally enters the land of another without lawful excuse. It is actionable _per se_, and thus the party whose land was entered may sue even if no actual harm is done.\n-   [Trespass to chattels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels \"Trespass to chattels\") – Committed when an individual intentionally interferes with the personal property of another. Slight deprivation, like briefly placing a hand on someone else's car, is not actionable.\n-   [Conversion (law)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(law) \"Conversion (law)\") – An intentional tort to personal property where the defendant's willful interference with the chattel deprives plaintiff of the possession of the same.\n-   [Nuisance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuisance \"Nuisance\") – Denial of quiet enjoyment to owners of [real property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_property \"Real property\"). A private nuisance is an unreasonable, unwarranted, or unlawful interference with another person's private use and enjoyment of his or her property; whereas a public nuisance is an interference with the rights of the public generally. The test to determine whether an interference is reasonable is whether the gravity of the harm is outweighed by the social benefit of the nuisance.\n\n### Dignitary torts\n\n[Dignitary torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignitary_torts \"Dignitary torts\") – a specific category of intentional torts where the cause of action is being subjected to certain kinds of indignities.\n\n-   [Defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation \"Defamation\") – The communication of a statement that makes a false claim, expressively stated or implied to be factual, that may harm the reputation of an entity.\n    -   [Libel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libel \"Libel\") – Written defamation\n    -   [Slander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slander \"Slander\") – Spoken defamation\n    -   [False light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_light \"False light\") – A tort unique to American jurisprudence which covers defamatory statements which, although true, can give rise to false negative perceptions of the claimant.\n-   [Invasion of privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_privacy \"Invasion of privacy\") – The unlawful intrusion into the personal life of another person without just cause.\n-   [Breach of confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_confidence \"Breach of confidence\") – Protects private information conveyed in confidence; typically requires that the information be of a confidential nature, communicated in confidence, and was disclosed to the detriment of the claimant.\n-   [Abuse of process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_process \"Abuse of process\") – A malicious and deliberate misuse or perversion of regularly issued court process not justified by the underlying legal action.\n-   [Malicious prosecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_prosecution \"Malicious prosecution\") – Similar to [abuse of process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_process \"Abuse of process\"), but includes intent, pursuing without probable cause, and dismissal in favor of the victim. In some jurisdictions, _malicious prosecution_ is reserved for the wrongful initiation of criminal proceedings, while _malicious use of process_ refers to the wrongful initiation of civil proceedings.\n-   [Alienation of affections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affections \"Alienation of affections\") – Brought by a spouse against a third party, whom the spouse believes has interfered with his or her marriage. There is no requirement that all affections in the marriage be destroyed, only that there has been some diminution in the love and affection between the married couple.\n\n### Economic torts\n\n[Economic torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_torts \"Economic torts\") – torts that provide the common law rules on liability which arise out of business transactions such as interference with economic or business relationships and are likely to involve pure economic loss.

The works done by me, with others, in these areas dates back to the 1995-6 or so; although those were very early days, and a great deal more was achieved from 2000 onwards.  Some of the old diagrams continue to present models, that remain similar; whilst some of the problems that were experienced even back then, still remain & in some ways have become far worse or minimally described - different, overtime.  \n    \n2.  By 2010 works had started on employing HTTP ‘Semantic Web’ tooling; which in-turn led to a significant involvement in the creation of new ‘web standards communities’ which led to new standards, of vast significance to humanity at large; given how they’ve been implemented.  Standards work is a different job, to producing software / applications that make use of the tools produced & made available (royalty free ‘patent pool protected’ standards, etc); to produce particular products, and as time goes on requirements shift.\n    \n3.  A Major constituency of the purposeful efforts has been to support human rights related ‘technological infrastructure’ apparatus.  A design focus, has been to consider the needs of the poor, the vulnerable and those in need of accessible & appropriate support for lawful considerations & available legal recourse / remedy (ie: natural justice); which is now demonstrably shown to have been an unusual focus, given what has been supported; and what continues to be in an area of distressing problems, that have not been resolved. \n    \n4. Whilst the modelling has direct applications for incorporate entity infrastructure (ie: corporate, government, education; in all the many areas); individuals in their private capacities needs to be provided ‘digital agency’ in-order to support anything else well; these considerations are discussed via the lens of ‘values’ and in particular ‘human rights’,\n\n5. Service to support ‘human rights’ are presently expensive (at least $120 AUD / PA, per entity group (ie: individual or family);  including but not limited to,\n\ta.  The Rental Costs for a Domain Name\n    b. The Service Costs for an online (“cloud”) server (hosting / vps, etc.) that provides support for ‘fixed IPs’ (HTTPS support)\n    \n6. The ability to support ‘home “read/write” applications that employ HTTP services (which is often not supported by residential internet connections); which in-turn means, that some sort of VPN like functionality is required.  \n      \n    NOTE: online services are subject to ‘choice of law’ terms, which are often not in the same jurisdiction as the intended beneficiary of that apparatus (indeed, they’re often not even in the same country).  \n\n7.  Technically; ‘Semantic Web’ uses HTTP URis. Whilst other non-http based protocols can be employed, there is still a requirement to ensure support for HTTP(s) & DNS (ie; domain name, email, etc) services.  There is also a lack of support for IPv6 in many areas, alongside other legacy issues linked to ICANN (the domain name business); Now therefore, there are complex issues that are emerging as a consequence of ‘web3’ (DLTs) solutions that are not the same as the Web (world-wide-web / www); or other protocols that operate on internet.  \n      \n    At a social level; the problem becomes the misuse of the concept of ‘identity’ in how it is applied to the use of tooling and the impact that has upon societies.  \n      \n    At a commercial level; the use of the term ‘identity’ is linked with commercial benefits should any one ‘thing’ (company, blockchain, etc.) control human entities, that is often very difficult to ‘stop using’ - a simple example, would be the dependencies upon public free email addresses provided by large organisations such as Microsoft (hotmail), Google (gmail) and Apple (iCloud) - although; even simply with respect to that one ‘identifier’, the semantic ‘stickiness’ also has implications with respect to accounts provided by internet providers, universities and employers.  Whilst there are MANY examples, the simple one of an ‘email address’, does in-turn have an array of dependency implications across many areas.  \n      \n    ‘Semantic Web’ refers to an ecosystem of parts principally developed via the W3C; which create the foundational requirements for artificial intelligence services through various tools that define how information is both structured and then able to be employed by systems that have been produced to use ‘semantic web’ tooling.  In-effect, its like Internet Protocol; for electronic (structured) information and information processing related services, which then in-turn powers ‘AI’. The designs required; need to bring the human agent, equitably (and responsibly) into the equations, which is able to be brought about using an ecosystem of tools; that in-turn have dependencies upon the use of HTTP ‘server related’ services. \n\n\n## Deliberations: Some recent architectural work and linked considerations.\n\nIn a 2017 presentation / talk on [“The End of Cloud Computing”](https://a16z.com/2019/11/15/the-end-of-cloud-computing-2/) General Partner of Andreessen Horowitz Peter Levine explains how cloud technology is changing for an edge cloud model.  \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4QTAtFaIiyc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nPut simply, Lavine presents the case illustrating how the mass of (IoT) devices ‘at the edge’ requires ‘edge processing’; or in other words, that the computational requirements for devices within ‘personal area networks’ cannot be supported by (international) ‘cloud computing’ capabilities alone.  Reviewing this presentation again recently, reminded me of the physics (in-effect) involved in effectively delivering modern capabilities - even if the moral considerations are not enough.  This ‘battle’ between ‘mainframe’ like systems, and personal computing - is a very old trend.  \n\nI have made a somewhat brief ‘Timeline Exhibit’ of various clips relating in particular to Steve Jobs & Tim Berners-Lee which can be found via the link below.\n\nThe creation, production & commercialisation of (cyber) infrastructure - cannot be done quickly enough; yet clearly, the historical / ‘legacy’ business models bound to WWW focused internet services - where global silos are the primary operators / definers of our means for advancement; is indeed problematic, and in-turn also - there are various barriers to creating solutions that can support inter-juristictionality, centred upon the needs of natural persons; as to thereby, uplift any other capacities human beings have in our societies, socio-economically, creatively & otherwise.\n\nThese major silos - are in-effect, highly centralised globally as are many ‘DLTs’ (ie: blockchains) although the characteristics are different.  As such, whilst there is a great deal of concern about ‘splinter-net’ or a world of many separate internets - this is in-effect, a difficult puzzle.  From a user-perspective, there’s already ‘separate internets’; such as Microsoft, Apple, Google & facebook; with others in other regions (ie: Asia, etc).   So with that being said…\n\nI find myself looking into VPN technologies as a means to support - in-effect - human agency.  One of the examples I have found is a SDN Networking technology called WireGuard which is then provided a services layer to support private networks via technologies such as TailScale, which is in-turn being supported by other open-source projects such as headscale.  What it does is create a privately addressable network that supports HTTP, TLS, DNS (ETC) enabling private networking of ‘read/write’ (distributed - semantic web based - services); alongside ‘exit nodes’ that provide an ability for a nominated service / server - to provide public-internet connectivity with the rest of the network; that is in-turn connected both, to ‘regular internet’ as well as the ‘private network’ that is set-up using these technologies.  More information about how this particular solution works can be found [https://tailscale.com/](https://tailscale.com/) (inc. blog, etc.). \n\nPart of what’s also occurring (note headscale, as noted above); is that there’s user-authentication using OIDC; and in-turn also, TLS certificates being issued to devices.  Whilst neither of these solutions appear to support ‘Web-ID’ ecosystem components (ie: SubjectAltName: FOAF (or RDF) URI); it does not appear to be a massive problem to add it; and in-turn, the opportunity becomes, packaging these tools (libraries / services) with either an updated ‘RWW (read-write-web)’ solution or indeed also, the more modern (yet different) solid related variants - or some future harmonisation of both; as a consequence of building and deploying solutions, that ‘make sense’. \n\n## CONSIDERATIONS: Leading to a Hypothesis\n\nRWW servers were originally designed to employ RDF, LDP WebID-TLS as an authentication instrument; and through that, the server was then able to be extended via various service layers (SPARQL, LDN, etc.).  There are old (webizen related) libraries that exist, but they’ve not been updated.  One example in particular, GOLD (Go Linked Data (or RWW) server) is written in GoLang (“Go”), as are the software libraries for Headscale / Tailscale.  \n\nSo, what if there was an integration done to produce ‘client apps’ (nodes) that support both the Private Networking topology with a bundled ‘RWW server’; alongside, a ‘server based’ version (“exit Node” / public gateway / designed for data-center related deployments); that may in-turn also provide support for provisioning & managing a customers domain name; whilst also providing an WebID-OIDC based IdP, that is in-turn used to deploy the WebID-TLS certs on client devices, that via WebID-TLS provides transparent authentication, via the TLS certificate WebID. \n\nThis approach, appears to end-up being closer to the original ‘rww’ works; than the newer’ works (to-date); noting, that the older RWW ‘apps’ (simple HTML5) were very simple to create by comparison to the newer ones(generally NodeJS / server based apps); that are in-fact far more complicated, as are the ‘access control’ issues.  Whilst the ‘decentralisation’ objective is good; the threat becomes, aggregating all of a person's life into a singular container that ends-up being exploited by bad actors; perhaps without any means to know about what might have occurred and/or been deleted or modified.  \n\n## ‘Home as a platform’ vs. ‘gov as a platform’.\n\nHome is where the heart is, but what will AI say, about how government money influences what occurs should people find themselves in a situation where they’ve got some very serious problems at home; what is it, do you think, AI will be able to demonstrate - what they’re priorities have actually been, as demonstrated by the outcomes.  Is the fear of #RealityCheckTech - undermining our capacity for peace?\n\nMuch of these works over, particularly over the past 12 years or so; has been undertaken in very difficult circumstances, with the express intent to ensure natural persons (human beings in their private capacity) were provided the technological tools required, to support their relationship with law & therefore, peace.  However, this has not been supported by the government, who has consequently funded the costs of significant harms and consequential enquiries and related costs.  The program known as ‘robodebt’ is a good example of the nature of these decisions; whereby, if people had of been supported to be able to store their own electronic evidence / legal records of importance; then, providing machine-readable payslips would have been easily performed and/or compelled to have been performed via lawful means.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to reasonably support any claim that Government will of its own volition, provide the cyber-infrastructure requirements needed by citizens, to protect their rights unto law and in-turn, act to support both our system of government and our means to protect our society from the harmful consequences of those engaged in organised activities causing serious injury to others; by ensuring, circumstances of a nature that should reasonably lead to a complaint being made in a court of law, are provided the supports needed to demonstrate governmental commitments to the various instruments that exist; whether it be UN instruments, including but not limited to the UDHR, or the principles set-forth in the Charter of the Commonwealth or indeed the specific statements made by various state and federal laws / legislation, conventions and legal precedents.  Put simply, the importance of useful employment of law / rule of law and in-turn its very important role with respect to peace and human rights; has not been demonstrated to have been provided the respect or support, needed, to protect the most vulnerable in our society, which is not about any discriminatory factors alone; rather, that the complex consequences of not providing an opportunity for alternative ‘business systems’ to emerge inter-domestically, will not stop the consequences of what will otherwise occur as Artificial Intelligence grows in its capacities and influences, via globally centralised platforms; or via alternative ecosystems.\n\n## Webizen Networks - by WebCivics (& Trust Factory)\n\nWebizen is a project that seeks to produce a new class of computing environment that incorporates many complex concepts that are not well understood by the vast majority; particularly, the details. \n\nNonetheless - The broad-strokes of it, is that its a sort of ‘information management fabric’ that i’ve been working on for a very long time; and, now decades later, there’s a bunch of work done by various other people around the world, many luminaries involved, whose collective efforts; enable the creation of an ecosystem, that works to address various - very significant problems; social, economic, cyber, (inc. AI), etc.\n\nThe hypothesis (as I've put it); of employing some sort of networking solution like the one mentioned, appears to reduce the effective entry-level cost significantly.  I think, its important to stipulate & structure the organisational approach (reflected in-turn by the technology topology) to support ‘common jurisdictional presence’ for legal entities; which in-turn means, that ‘by default’, users would ‘sign-up’ to a webizen networking / Semantic (AI) SDN service that has contractual arrangements within their jurisdiction.\n\nThese systems also maintain some level of ‘controls’ via the end-node interfaces and the capabilities built there.  In a worst-case scenario where a bad-actor needs to be ‘shut-down’ that could be done at the IdP; equally, an array of other capabilities can be provided as a distributed processing capability, providing HTTP services whilst at a lower-cost than is otherwise able to occur, through the use of existing VPS solutions alone.  This business model, requires support via a particular form of commercial (for purpose) approach; but, is aimed at providing mechanisms / methodologies, to support a differentiation between the capabilities needed to defend our societies from the threats of crime internationally; vs. domestic / local approaches, and in-turn also (governance) responsibilities and other aspects relating to the ‘right to self determination’ (human rights / democracy / prevention/protection from foreign interference, etc.) & access to justice. \n\nSo, if this were done in a way; that is consistent with the various ‘human rights’ related considerations, which in-turn relate to licensing and other mechanisms to support dignity and address ‘digital slavery’ issues; whilst maintaining (indeed enhancing) support for the creation of software for the good of humanity; there are centralisation related implications, unlike ‘web 2.0’ or “#Web3”; and provide a capacity to produce electronic governance frameworks, to support cooperative, Collaborative and supportive socio-economic ecosystems, Inter-juristictionally / internationally; noting, these systems, do not prevent ‘old internet’ from continuing to function, it just provides a different environment for different kinds of apps / computing platforms / work & AiTech environments; that seeks, to mediate operational tasks, in a way that accelerates our capacity to improve productivity and radically extend our support for a regenerative and rejuvenative evolutionary paradigm shift, as a consequence of good designs for the use of ICT Tools. \n\n Yet, this is an R&D process; which is expected to evolve overtime and will be particularly vulnerable at the early stages of any ‘commercialisation’ (including software production); via well funded adversaries. \n\n## Design Considerations - as an initial ‘options analysis’ derivative.\n\nIF, this path is investigated and/or further developed; then considerations are as follows,\n\n### User Experience\n\n1.  User goes to webizen.au (for example) and sets-up an account.\n    \n2.  Once the account is setup (with or without their own domain, etc.) then they can download ‘client software’ which is basically a ‘vpn’ like thing that has a RWW ‘social-web /  webizen server’ baked into it; which then operates in a federated manner with other devices in their ‘private network’.\n    \n3.  User then creates or downloads apps that depend upon these services existing; whereby the app is simply ‘client side’ pulling the data from the network; and using local machine resources to perform various tasks. (there are various libraries for Go app development that support interfaces for media processing, cuda, tensor, etc.). \n    \n4.  The user then downloads the clients for other devices; and the ‘information environment’ works in a federated manner.  This provides an opportunity to assign ‘capabilities’ of different devices in the users network, and distribute tasks to different agents (servers) programmably.\n    \n\n### Notes about ‘solid’ vs. RWW vs. ‘Webizen’\n\nAs noted in related documentation, the term ‘webizen’ was used by the ‘original ‘RWW’ team; and whilst honouring their efforts is part of the moral goals of the project; there are also alot of changes being made.\n\n-   It's not seemingly a topology that is ‘the same’ as solid: there are other factors / elements of the broader ‘webizen’ design that are also different, so this isn’t necessarily a problem, noting, solid is also a ‘work in progress’ and their specifications may well change based upon what Tim Berners-lee (or other influencers involved) believe is the most appropriate approach, as does develop overtime.  \n      \n-   There is possibility of providing, what is in-effect, ‘transparent’ authentication at the ‘device’ or ‘user-account’ level; via the TLS certificate (WebID-TLS / WebID-RSA, etc) to personalise the session, which is in-turn authenticated against a user when they set-up the network ‘node’.  \n      \n-   An ability to support some sort of log-in/log-out (WebID-OIDC based) on shared computers is needed.  There are also considerations to make about others using someone else's device (ie: children, or someone else - who may not be behaving in a ‘friendly’ manner).\n    \n-   2nd factor AUTH could be supported via various devices in a network (ie: a smartphone) by assigning that device a role to perform that task.  This and many other ‘features’ / workflows; would ideally be relatively simple to create (ie: via web-assets rather than continual upgrades to the underlying compiled runtime) as often as possible.  \n      \n-   Another implication is that, due to the ‘data storage structure’, disconnection from the network doesn’t result in a user loosing their data; which is one of many positive qualities of this approach.  \n      \n-   The future ‘webizen’ platform - will require a great deal more work & capabilities to deliver the sorts of capabilities that is sought to be brought about; whether or not ‘go’ is right for the client in the long-term, is yet to be known.  There are ‘bindings’ for other languages; but overall, there’s a need to create a platform that can support the development of the broader ‘webizen’ project, including but not limited to the delivery of initial that are very much focused on providing a ‘solid’ or ‘rww’ like, environment, that can be easily employed by persons working from home or wherever they are; to collaboratively do work through ‘web apps’ that are cheaply employable.   \n      \n    Without forming some sort of decentralised foundation for how people are able to work with one another; the outcome of being able to decentralise and support the purpose of these works, has never before actually been delivered.  In-part, this is a commercial issue that’s hard to address once investment has gone into whatever the ‘proof of concept’ body of work is; and thereby, socialised to other persons whose focus is most often about how to make the most out of it all.  \n      \n-   A Loosely coupled approach; could also provide support for other groups to produce similar solutions using different protocols, or indeed also, the ability for future clients; to support an array of different protocols - a bit like plugins or extensions i guess…  This would in-turn require a specification defining what is required to support specific functionality in relation to use cases.\n    \n-   Note also; there are various ‘packages’ such as ‘nextcloud’ and its office-app functionality, alongside various other ‘web-apps’ that can be run relatively easily, on a high-powered laptop or desktop like device (basically - on consumer equipment); but the hosting costs / set-up processes, have historically been prohibitive.   \n      \n    Whilst further integration opportunities are very interesting, there’s also a meaningful opportunity to provide near-immediate support for users to get these sorts of platforms working at home, at nominal cost, for private groups; which is envisaged to significantly uplift innovation & productivity.  \n\n\n# GOALS\n\n1.

The Concept of Decentralised Ontologies is about structuring and consequentially providing ontologies via decentralised protocols.\n\nA list of non-http based protocols is illustrated [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]] although, different technologies are better suited to different types of applications and in-turn have different requirements, features, flaws and functionality.  Decentralised Ontologies is both part of the broader [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] frameworks and a fundamental part of the specification for it.  Whilst the distinctions are somewhat nuanced; the use of ontologies is critical to structuring other forms of commons resources on decentralised protocols as ontologically referenceable information / informatics resources.\n\n#### Background\n\nThere has been a historic and long-term problem with temporal resolution of 'web' (WWW) content.  This problem has also impacted the availability of 'ontologies', which are the structured vocabularies (semantics) that support the development and use of applications that are dependant upon those ontologies.  In-turn also, ontologies change overtime; whereas the HTTP URI may not. \n\nThen there is also the problem that the use of public (hosted somewhere) ontological resources (particularly in relation to 'commons' information) is often accessed via an API during runtime.  So, the implication becomes a form of API based survellience in relation to activities of humans. \n\nSo in summary; It is desirable to have,\n1. ontologies stored locally (or at least within a 'private network' env) \n2. An ability to manage 'versions' of an ontology that remain 'static'\n3. An ability to assert access control (Read/Write/Append); in a manner that takes into account social factors (ie: stewards vs. consumers / dependents)\n\nSo the purpose of decentralised ontologies (which is part of the Permissive Commons ecosystems) is to create an information systems framework that supports the ability for different authoritative actors / agents (inc. groups) to produce different ontologies and manage the authorship of them; whilst also enabling users to download a copy of those ontologies for use locally (with a semantic / AI agent); and therefore also, any applications that depend upon those ontologies being available, no-longer rely upon whether they're still availalbe on the HTTP URI where they were originally published; but rather, on the DLT (decentralised ledger technology) still being available somewhere.

In-order to provide some background resources are provided via the [GitHub link for this CG](https://github.com/w3c/cogai#positioning-relative-to-existing-approaches-to-ai).  In-order to get a more generic summary, i've queried ChatGPT.\n\n### ChatGPT Notes\n\nMy Question: Define Plausible Reasoning as it relates to Cognative AI Agents?\n\n***ChatGPT Answer:***\n\nPlausible reasoning refers to the ability of a cognitive AI agent to generate reasonable and likely explanations for a given situation or problem, based on the information and knowledge it has been trained on. It involves understanding the context of a problem and applying relevant knowledge and reasoning techniques to generate a plausible solution or explanation. This type of reasoning is important in tasks such as natural language understanding, decision making, and problem solving.\n\nPlausible reasoning is a form of probabilistic reasoning, which means that the AI agent considers multiple possible explanations and assigns a probability to each one based on the available evidence. This allows the agent to deal with uncertainty and make decisions based on the best available information.\n\nIn natural language understanding, for example, a cognitive AI agent with plausible reasoning capabilities would be able to understand the meaning of a sentence, even if it contains ambiguities or missing information. It would generate multiple possible interpretations of the sentence and choose the most likely one based on the context and the available knowledge.\n\nIn decision making, a cognitive AI agent with plausible reasoning capabilities would be able to make informed decisions, even in situations where the available information is incomplete or uncertain. It would consider multiple possible outcomes and choose the one that is most likely to achieve the desired goal.\n\nIn summary, plausible reasoning allows cognitive AI agents to generate reasonable and likely explanations or solutions based on incomplete or uncertain information. It is an important aspect of artificial intelligence research and is crucial for building intelligent agents that can operate in real-world environments.\n\n***My Question:***\n\nwhat fields of mathematics are used to design cognitive AI Plausible Reasoning software systems that are designed to work with Semtantic Web technologies such as RDF and RDFS, etc.\n\n***ChatGPT Answer:***\n\nCognitive AI systems that are designed to work with semantic web technologies such as RDF and RDFS typically use a combination of mathematical techniques from several fields, including:\n\n1.  Graph theory: RDF and RDFS use a graph-based data model, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between entities. Graph theory is used to analyze and manipulate the structure of these graphs.\n    \n2.  Logic: Logical reasoning is used to make inferences about the relationships between entities in the RDF graph. Description Logic (DL) is a subset of First-order Logic (FOL) that is often used for this purpose.\n    \n3.  Probability and statistics: Plausible reasoning in AI systems often involve probability and statistics, as the agent must assign probabilities to different possible outcomes or explanations. Bayesian networks, Markov decision process and Gaussian Process are few examples that are used in this area.\n    \n4.  Machine learning: Machine learning techniques are used to train the AI system to make predictions or inferences based on the RDF data. This could be supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning depending on the problem at hand.\n    \n5.  Optimization: Optimization algorithms are used to find the best possible solution to a problem, given a set of constraints. Linear programming, convex optimization and other optimization techniques are used in AI systems.\n    \n6.  Natural Language Processing (NLP): Many semantic web applications involve natural language text, and NLP techniques are used to extract meaning from the text and relate it to entities in the RDF graph. This may include techniques such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis.\n    \n7.  Information retrieval: Information retrieval techniques are used to search and retrieve relevant information from the RDF graph. This may include techniques such as keyword-based search, semantic search, and graph-based search.\n    \n8.  Knowledge representation: Techniques such as ontologies and conceptual modeling are used to represent knowledge in a structured and formal way, making it easier for the AI system to understand and reason about the data.\n    \n9.  Distributed Systems: Some semantic web applications involve distributed data, and distributed systems techniques are used to manage and coordinate access to the data.\n    \n10.  Cyber Security: As with any system that handle sensitive data, security is of prime importance. Techniques from cryptography and secure protocols are used to secure the communication and storage of data.\n    \n\nIn summary, cognitive AI systems that work with semantic web technologies such as RDF and RDFS use a combination of mathematical techniques from various fields such as graph theory, logic, probability and statistics, machine learning, optimization, natural language processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, distributed systems and cyber security to make inferences about the relationships between entities in the RDF graph and generate plausible explanations or solutions.\n\nCognitive AI systems that work with semantic web technologies such as RDF and RDFS use a combination of mathematical techniques from graph theory, logic, probability and statistics, machine learning and optimization to make inferences about the relationships between entities in the RDF graph and generate plausible explanations or solutions.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SocialAttackVectors/CriminalActivity/CorporateCrime/","title":"Corporate Crime"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Corporate Crime\n\n*Chat AI:*\n\nCorporate crime refers to illegal or unethical activities that are committed by a business or corporation.

In-turn, the objective is to seek to address a number of underlying issues that are considered to be problems with it.\n\n#### Webizen Diagram: A Basic UseCase Illustration\n\n![[webizen_diagram_1-2.jpg]]\n\nThe above diagram was produced as part of the process of seeking to get some sort of grasp on how to address the [[GuardianshipRelations]] problems. Part of the purpose of the illustration, is to denote the difference between a persons 'private and personal' [inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) (seeAlso: [[TheSemanticInforg&TheHumanCentricWeb — RealityCheckTech]]) and the resources that are electronically supplied as a consequence of social involvement with others.\n\nThis is intended to be empowered via [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/ValuesCredentials]] which in-turn require core ontologies; that are sought to be delivered using the PCT ecosystems.  \n\nThereafter; the effect of these components, are intended to support the private operation of 'Webizen' (Agents). \n\n***NOTE:  the end-concept of a 'webizen', is that it is a distinguishable class of robot, that is owned by an entity who is responsible for how it is made to operate; and that, all human beings using them, must first have their own.  This in-turn acts to support, [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]], [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI]] via tooling, that will include a  [[HumanCentricOntology]] structure - that can be further improved upon overtime***\n\n***The objective for now, is to define the requirements to establish a functional [[Webizen]] ecosystem that is then able to be used to further progress the works, upon a common set of principals and technology that supports those socio-economic and technological foundations*** \n\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nHTTP(s) Ontologies are published online using a HTTP server and ICANN DNS.  \n\nPROBLEM 1:  Often these resources disappear and may only later be found by searching for a record of it in [archive.org](https://archive.org/) or on github.  \n\nPROBLEM 2: The documents (and embedded semantics) may change without notice; and without a known mechanism to distinguish between the intended semantic meanings when defining the document vs. the future definitions that are engendered as a consequence of the content of an ontological dependency changing. \n\nPROBLEM 3:  The level of know-how relating to the production of ontologies can often lead to unintended meanings being semantically defined. \n\nPROBLEM 4:  Tools are most-often defined to be built around OWL which has a top-level concept of 'thing' and not everything relating to our conscious experience of life, is about things; nor are all entities things.\n\nPROBLEM 5:  In-order to decentralise and empower human kind, there must be a way to decentralise AI.  There are various complex reasons, implications and consequences; and whilst these sorts of ideologies may not be universally sought, for those who do want to ensure a means for tooling to support the needs of themselves and others as human beings in a way that requires Decentralised (Human Centric) AI - decentralising ontologies (and other assets) in a manner that can (with the use of cryptography alongside other patterns) provide a fit-for-purpose capacities to participatorily create, make use of and rely upon electronic resources - is essential for all persons who exist in socio-economic structures that are managed using electronic systems.\n\nAs far as i am aware, there are not presently well-defined or well-known solutions that are 'fit for purpose' in relation to the requirements of the webizen project; The technical challenges include,\n\n1. Defining a way to create ontologies (documents) that are referencable; and,\n\ta. 'tamper evident'\n\tb. temporally distinguishable.\n\tc. Able to be targeted as a specific version or group; with logic support for different usecases.\n\t\n2. Defining cryptography methods 'ecosystem' that support the various usecases. (permissions, provonance, etc.)\n   \n3. Support inferencing methods for 'common sense' related functions; including, a means to process and formulate appropriate responses if the derivative of a functional request renders a result that is 'unclear' (ie: not binary - Yes/No)\n   \n4. Social Factors;\n\t\n\ta. Provide explainability of decision making processes; including, via the use of permission systems that may distinguish the rights of access to resources based upon external factors (ie: a victim / perpetrator making claims, vs. the capacities of a judge/jury in a court of law)\n\t\n\tb. Support for Children (ie: Content classifications)\n\t\n\tc. Support for storing and maintaining access to the information created by persons who have become deceased.\n\t\n\td. Self-Archiving related methodologies; ideally, 'useful content' should never dissapear entirely; unless it becomes the case that no human being on the planet (voluntarily) wants to store it; or that it relates to some other complex use-case involving dignity (even then, perhaps the information should be stored somewhere as evidence, idk.  perhaps laws?)\n\t\n\te. Support for basic economic considerations to be built into the protocols:  This is not about the commercial abuse of a payments system, rather, it is about seeking to ensure that there is a caculation done on the biosphere and socio-sphere implications, as to provide protocol level evidence of such things as energy use and a means to abolish the support that is presently wide-spread witth respect to issues such as digital slavery.\n\n\n#### Design Implications\n\nSomehow there needs to be;\n\n- A foundational ontology that defines requirements for a data-structure.\n- A methodology that is able to be deployed over multiple [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]]\n\n##### Broader Considerations\n\nDNS:  it is entirely possible that part of the solution may be to advance solutions that provide an update to DNS. If this is the case, the solution would need to work Side-By-Side with existing DNS.  \n\nSocioEconomics:  There are material costs and gains associated with every human being, irraspective of age or competency.  Existing systems have defines means to extract economic value in relation to any human entity; but they have not well defined how to ensure every human entity is also entitled to be a beneficiary; and indeed also, how that might work. \n\nThe [[GuardianshipRelations]] document provides some initial texts in relation to this topic.\n\n## PCT Ontology Modelling Requirements\n\n[[TheValuesProject]] seeks to employ various pre-existing well-known instruments; such as those that have been created via the United Nations and various other internationally well regarded groups and institutions, that are not presently available in an [[SemanticWeb]] based format.  Some information about existing [[Ontologies]] is provided via that link (although, not exhaustively). \n\nIn-order to support the [[SafetyProtocols]] and related ecosystems, some core work on the ontology methods is required; which will in-turn lead to the development of an ecosystem method for [[SocioSphereOntologies]] and [[BiosphereOntologies]] to compliment existing systems that are well defined for `owl:thing` related requirements.\n\nAdditionally, \n- well known ontologies such as FOAF are now fairly outdated; \n- Most reasoning / ontologicial systems are very much centered aruond the use of OWL; which has a top-level predicate defining anything that employs it as a sub-classes of `owl:thing` \n- Ontologies are currently designed to refer to HTTP-URIs.  By employing [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]] a method to define how to support various [[PCT-Webizen-Notes]] is thereby invoked.\n- A foundational structure needs to be defined to thereafter built upon; and some consideration is being made about what the most appropriate approach may well be.  \n\nThereafter, once these considerations are better understood; then, there is an ability to create the ontological structures of those ontology documents, including references to other `.wellknown` ontologies and related intended inferencing models, can be better modelled.  \n\n\n## PCT Ontology Modelling Method\n\n### Ground-Up ontological modelling ideas....\n\n##### Atomic Ontologies\n\nThe concept of Atomic Ontologies - is about the idea of forming an ontological approach that describes one term; rather than an entire syntax.  thereafter, a group of these atomic ontological resources could be used to define more comprehensive ontological structures.\n\n##### Foundational Requirements: RDF Dictionaries?\n\nIn-order to address the semantic ontology problems, perhaps the best way is to define a new approach to forming the foundational ontology via a different sort of modelling technique. \n\nAn idea of how this may be achieved; is via the use of a dictionary as a sourcefile; for Generating a semantic dictionary using AI (NN/DL/ML); which may then act as a datasource for the creation of an app that provides support for modelling an ontological structure based upon those fundamental predicates. \n\nThis initial process, would likely not include an array of terms that relate to brands and various areas of science, yet, the same process could be undertaken with other dictionaries.\n\nThereby providing a means to create a mapping technique between the historical / traditional foundational predicates; and in-turn, the ability to generate more meaningful relationships with the meaning of other terms; and thereby provide an underlying context for producing ontological (knowledge) modelling.  \n\nWhilst i'm not sure if this theory has merit; i'm working to figure out how it might work now...  \n\nPart of the consideration is; whether and/or how these sorts of requirements might fit into an ecosystem that is designed to employ [[CognitiveAI]] related applied computer science theories and principles. \n\nNowTherefore; a few questions with unknown answers.\n\n### Forming Trustworthy Ontological Structures\n\nThe existing Sematnic Web tooling, is built upon HTTP(s) Identifiers and as noted otherwise, there are an array of qualities that are considered to be issues.  \n\nGiven the permissive commons ecosystem works provide a foundational opportunity to redefine how these sorts of things are implemented; in a new and different sort of way that may extend beyond merely ensuring support via protocols other than HTTP(s) and related version control and permissions related ecosystem characteristics.\n\nI am now therefore working through some ideas that will remain largely undefined until the though processes are somewhat advanced (as a consequence of having done the work).\n\n### Discovery work\n\nThe content below is the discovery work that is being defined as it is written / produced, that is seeking to process a series of complex problems without a known answer or defined approach; as to catalogue related considerations in-order to create one (an approach)\n\nHow to best construct an artificial learning model that provides a coheasive data-set as to support a systematic method for foundational principals that can then in-turn be employed for producing [[SocioSphereOntologies]], [[BiosphereOntologies]] and most importantly a [[HumanCentricOntology]].\n\nThe first objective would be to describe a method that can be used to create a resource (software) that is able to be used with the english language. \n\n*(it goes without saying, that other languages should be supported - but i'm focusing firstly, upon the language i mostly use and best know)*\n\nQUESTION:  is it better to start with the use of english or the use of mathematics; or is it best to ensure the use of both, in-order to create a bridge between human use of linquistics and the computational use of human language, in a way that's in-turn going to be used computationally.  \n\n### English Language Concepts\n\nA few core concepts;\n\n- Sentence - a set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing a subject and predicate, conveying a statement, question, exclamation, or command, and consisting of a main clause and sometimes one or more subordinate clauses.\n- word - a single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing, used with others (or sometimes alone) to form a sentence and typically shown with a space on either side when written or printed.\n- morphemes - a meaningful morphological unit of a language that cannot be further divided (e.g. _in_, _come_, _-ing_, forming _incoming_ ).\n- Grammar - the whole system and structure of a language or of languages in general, usually taken as consisting of syntax and morphology (including inflections) and sometimes also phonology and semantics.\n- meaning - what is meant by a word, text, concept, or action.\n- known - recognized, familiar, or within the scope of knowledge.\n- explained - make (an idea or situation) clear to someone by describing it in more detail or revealing relevant facts.\n- antecedent - a thing that existed before or logically precedes another.\n- consequent - following as a result or effect.\n- Translation - the process of translating words or text from one language into another.\n- sense - a faculty by which the body perceives an external stimulus; one of the faculties of sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch.\n- Common Sense - good sense and sound judgement in practical matters.\n- Definition - a statement of the exact meaning of a word, especially in a dictionary.\n\nNOTE: above definitions are generally provided in relation to the use of the term as a noun.\n\n**1. NOUN** - **A noun is the name of a person, place, thing, or idea.**\n**2. PRONOUN** - **A pronoun is a word used in place of a noun.**\n**3. VERB** - **A verb expresses action or being.**\n**4. ADJECTIVE** - **An adjective modifies or describes a noun or pronoun.**\n**5. ADVERB** - **An adverb modifies or describes a verb, an adjective, or another adverb.**\n**6. PREPOSITION** - **A preposition is a word placed before a noun or pronoun to form a phrase modifying another word in the sentence.**\n**7. CONJUNCTION** - **A conjunction joins words, phrases, or clauses.**\n**8. INTERJECTION** - **An interjection is a word used to express emotion.**\n\nOne of the Antecedent to words is letters of an alphabet, which may in-turn be expressed in an array of computational codes - here's [a tool that illustrates this](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html).\n\n### Computational Language Concepts.\n\nWhilst seeking to make the note, i also understand the fundamental nature of it; apologies, \n\nComputers fundamentally 'speak' binary.  Various abstrations are thereby created, which are fundamentally based upon mathematics.   \n\nThere are various 'command' structures that relate to different computational models; relating both, to hardware and software based instruction-sets.  The way through which this is performed has a significant impact on the amount of power (energy) and time (amount of processing required) to achieve some sort of derivative function.  Higher level languages or abstractions (from a computing point of view) are able to engender results that other lower-level methodologies are able to achieve with less time (computational horsepower) / energy.  \n\nComputers are not manufactured to comprehend natural (human) language; although, it is increasingly 'done' via increasingly sophistocated systems, etc.  \n\n###### **Consideration:**\n\nIf a possible approach to generate a foundational ontology relating to the use of the english language is able to be produced (and consequentially via use / contributions, refined); is it better to start with the predicates relating to computational language concepts, or human (natural) language concepts? or, is a AI model defined to process a model that involves both?\n\nWhilst the diagram is most certainly flawed / incorrect (requires more work) the general gist of the concept that i'm working through is difficult to conceptually construct; so i hope this helps (even if / as it has errors) - noting in particular, the importance of [[PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/EconomicSystems/Centricity]] factors...\n\n![[AIOntology_concept_Issues.jpg]]\n\nTherein - the general idea or concept is; to process the english language via a AI Process (meaning DL, ML, NN, CNN, etc.) in a manner that can thereafter be used to define a tool (Software Program) for producing RDF based ontologically defined assets / code (documents). \n\nThe intended useful purpose of this program is to foundationally support the development of PCT Ontologies, which are in-turn a critical requirement for the production of PCT more broadly; including but not limited to, furnishing the means for others to form alternative and/or different foundational ontological schemas and related processes for logic mapping.\n\n\nProcessing Dimentionalities\n\n- Time\n- Energy\n\nBoth time and energy have complex attribution frameworks associated with the useful application of those concepts to different constituent 'ecosystems' processes.\n\n- Correctness and implication of incorrectness\n\nMethods to consider uncertainty. \n\n- Centricity\n\nEmploying an Agent Centric Approach which employs the use of cryptography; whilst ensuring the operational use of it, is HumanCentric.  \n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SocialAttackVectors/CriminalActivity/EnvironmentalCrime/","title":"Environmental Crime"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Environmental Crime\n\nThis can include activities such as illegal dumping of hazardous waste or violation of environmental regulations."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SocialAttackVectors/CriminalActivity/FinancialCrimes/","title":"Financial Crimes"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Financial Crimes\n\n*OpenAI:*\n\nFinancial crimes are illegal activities that involve the misuse or manipulation of financial systems or instruments for personal or financial gain.

I relate the practice of slavery to two different concepts of “alienation from self”: first, as being “owned” as property by a third party; and, second, as being “owned” in a more informal, contemporary sense, through the removal of an individual’s ability to govern her own life. This dual meaning of alienation from self leads me to consider self-ownership in a legal sense as well as, less formally, as having the agency to determine one’s own life. From both perspectives I claim that the increasing trafficking of personal data to supply algorithm-based analytics and AI is enabling a new form of digital enslavement that has the potential to curtail liberty and cause harm. I suggest that the conceptualization of problematic digital practices as a new form of slavery is a much needed addition to the mainstream critique of the collection, aggregation and trafficking of personal data, which has focused mostly on individual privacy. \n\nThis focus, in turn, has obscured and diminished the seriousness of concerns about collective and individual autonomy.\n\n[**#SlaveTech A snapshot of slavery in a digital age**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ueLcAiuue26NIZRyhSD8UGdx2vEBKSht/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThousands of years ago Aristotle wrote that ‘the ox is the poor man’s slave’. But how can an ox be a slave? And how is a slave like an ox? The crucial link is that in this context, both the ox and the human are being used as tools. In fact, Aristotle said exactly that in his book Politics: “some tools are lifeless and others living”, explaining that “for a helmsman the rud- der is a lifeless tool and the enslaved watchman a live tool.” It is not too difficult to think of animals and people as ‘tools’, and while it is less likely we would say an animal or a man is ‘technology’, they are and can be that too. In modern English slang, calling someone a “tool” is a put- down, an insult. And most of us would shy away from so di- minishing a person’s humanity, so reducing their personhood, by thinking or saying that another human being is only a tool. Recognition of our common humanity leads us to hate the idea of treating people as things. But that may be why we fail to see how closely linked technology (tools) and slavery can be, and so fail to see how the ox and the slave are similar, and how their differences make the slave the much more profitable and useful of the two.\n\n[**Modern Indentured Servitude in the Gig Economy: A Case Study on the Deregulation of the Taxi Industry in the United States**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WCuTv-P0yyDRIPi0qC8WRdInLrb4vtQo/view?usp=sharing)\n\nUnsustainable business model: The broken promises of Gig economy companies While corporations like Uber pursue intensified vehicular autonomy, that which has lured so many workers to the Gig economy in the United States has been hope in the American dream through the promise of ongoing employment . In part, jobs driving Uber taxis have been made possible by a seemingly viable business model that became unsustainable all too quickly. Drivers were told they could work for a ride-hailing company like Uber, and they could choose to work whenever they wanted. But what drivers were not told upon signing up, or on leasing or buying a new vehicle to drive for Uber, is that their per mile and per minute rate would be slashed without warning, not once but consecu- tively. Drivers were not told that they would be left to fend for themselves if things did not go according to plan and the business model became unviable.\n\n[**Combating Human Trafficking With Threat Intelligence — Prevention**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UYdDwCixirGYg7X1hE2Delq4B7tv8-E1/view?usp=sharing)\n\nEradication of human trafficking requires the expertise, resources, and efforts of many individuals and organizations. It is a complex issue requiring a multifaceted approach set in the United Nations’ Palermo Protocol known as the “4P” paradigm — Prevention, Protection, Prosecution, and Partnership. The 4P paradigm serves as the foundational framework used universally to combat human trafficking.\n\n[**Combating modern slavery experienced by Vietnamese nationals en route to, and within, the UK**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sow7NsyVQXX7AA-o6gSXpg4xy_tWZYn9/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIn 2016 the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner (IASC) commissioned research to examine the dynamics of Vietnamese nationals’ exploitation en route to, and within, the United Kingdom (UK).

It is essential to sense-making and cooperation and so then to the fundamental processes of human life. It is complex in its operations and so in its descriptions; it means different things to different people in different contexts. In light of the deep digitalization of our world, developments in computer science affect everyone. Many applications of computer science concern people and relationships, our interactions with each other and with digital technology, and with our cyborgian extension, and so I can only consider the diligent digital mediation and augmentation of human identity to be the discipline’s foremost challenge. Historic systemizations of identity have brought advantages and disadvantages, great benefits and grave harms, and I have this in mind when observing computer scientists currently developing protocols and technologies to systematize a narrow conceptualization of identity at scales and with a potential intensity never before contemplated let alone pursued. We need to have a deeper think about this.\n\n[**Paving a Digital Road to Hell?

The initial focus was on the digital transformation of welfare states in the Global North, including in the United States and United Kingdom.1 However, during the preparation of the 2019 Special Rapporteur’s report to the UN General Assembly on digital welfare states,2 many practitioners and academic experts drew our attention to a specific model of digital identification systems, frequently with biometric components (digital ID systems), which is being deployed by national governments in the Global South. Recognizing that these systems raise major human rights concerns that go far beyond the realm of Northern welfare states, we have spent the past few years increasingly engaged in national and international debates on digital ID.\n\n[**Human and Machine Consciousness**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-4509pvw8Iwo_yk6QtIxqzY1UopoycT3/view?usp=sharing)\n\nConsciousness is extremely important to us. Without consciousness, there is just nothingness, death, night. It is a crime to kill a person who is potentially conscious. Permanently unconscious people are left to die. Religious people face death with hope because they believe that their conscious souls will break free from their physical bodies. We know next to nothing about consciousness and its relationship to the physical world. The science of consciousness is mired in philosophical problems. We can only guess about the consciousness of coma patients, infants and animals. We have no idea about the consciousness of artificial systems.\n\n[**The Age of Digital Interdependence**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oI0S8hJpm_BUB64heZ3J4dmP36FvQw8D/view?usp=sharing)\n\nDigital technologies are rapidly transforming society, simultaneously allowing for unprecedented advances in the human condition and giving rise to profound new challenges. Growing opportunities created by the application of digital technologies are paralleled by stark abuses and unintended consequences. Digital dividends co-exist with digital divides. And, as technological change has accelerated, the mechanisms for cooperation and governance of this landscape have failed to keep pace. Divergent approaches and ad hoc responses threaten to fragment the interconnectedness that defines the digital age, leading to competing standards and approaches, lessening trust and discouraging cooperation.\n\n\n[**Crypto & DeFi Hacks, Fraud & Scams Report**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DspMneosLPsSdFX6QSjgfr3XPmUxo12Q/view?usp=sharing)\n\nDespite the constant evolution and maturation of blockchain technology and the crypto market, 167 attacks on Decentralized Finance protocols, 123 security attacks, and 74 fraudulent schemes over the last 11 years have so far resulted in the theft of approximately USD $14.58 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets in total at the time of writing this report (July 2022).\n\n\n[**The Promise and Perils of International Human Rights Law for AI Governance**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YvsBvPxRKZ_Nmh_17SupJ8CAkMjF4HZD/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe use and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) presents many challenges for human rights. Consequently, the search for an AI governance framework has led to a relatively recent proliferation of government strategies, corporate ethics codes, engineering design ethics, and international regulatory frameworks that seek to regulate its application. For purposes of this paper, AI—a term that has no consensus definition in technology and policymaking circles1—refers to a complex information system that approximates behavior commonly understood as requiring intelligence, similar to human behavior, such as pattern recognition, logical reasoning, or language processing.\n\n[**The Commodification of Knowledge and Information**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lztgk-MSbS22vAPyzSk5mNF4InLTjfnW/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIn this paper we present an analysis of the commodification of knowledge and information in contemporary capitalism. We provide a consistent account of how information as a commodity effects the workings of both capitalism and of Marxist theory. The first part of the paper critically revisits Marx’s own writings on the commodification of knowledge and how the immaterial labour hypothesis initially interpreted these writings. Based on the new categories knowledge-commodity and knowledge-rent, we then present our own approach in response to the challenges raised by the immaterial labour hypothesis. Lastly, we analyse the more recent contributions on the commodification of knowledge and information within the Marxist literature. The current debate on the value of knowledge has been divided between two camps: the reproduction cost approach, and the average cost approach. At the end of the paper we present empirical estimates of the magnitudes of knowledge-rents.\n\n[**Beyond Data Alessandro Mantelero Foreword by Prof. Joe Cannataci Human Rights, Ethical and Social Impact Assessment in AI**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SLZpk3Je-QG7M0i7XbivmPg4EKqIXoAZ/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIt is probably safe to say that at the time of writing1 more than 99% of the world’s population do not yet understand what a game-changer AI can be...or is already proving to be. Much news coverage, for example, is still given to efforts which aim to prevent states like Iran or North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and increasingly sophisticated means of delivering them. Yet relatively little news coverage is given to the fact that, in reality, AI has made nuclear weapons obsolete. Why would a state—or indeed a terrorist—wish to deploy or acquire a very expensive and relatively unstable nuclear weapon when it can instead deploy much cheaper AI-controlled devices which do not create a radioactive crater or destroy so many valuable assets in a target zone?\n\n[White Paper eDATA Verifiable Credentials for Cross Border Trade](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wGmuNE22cAk3HFJqggvOldz8g484BqIr/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe international supply chain is growing in complexity at the same time as nation states seek to improve their border compliance for imports and facilitate access to export markets for their domestic producers. The global value chain is highly dependent on smooth cross-border supply flows (tangible, intangible, and data). In an uncertain world that is buffeted by rapid technological change, environmental and health crises, and political uncertainties, national policies can have significant impacts on cross border trade challenges.\n\nThe “cost of trade”2 roughly doubles the landed price of goods in export markets (compared to domestic wholesale prices) with around one third of that cost related to non-tariff border costs. Nations that can reduce their cost of trade with their trading partners will confer a significant comparative advantage for their exporters and thereby improve the national balance of trade.\n\n·  At around $1.7 Trillion USD, the trade finance gap (i.e. trade finance requested but not approved) is heavily weighted against small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and acts as one of the most significant barriers to SME participation in cross-border trade. Nations who can uplift SME participation rate in cross border trade will experience greater growth and improved balance of trade.\n\n·  At around 3% of world trade volume, the value of fake / illicit goods trade is at least $600Bn and rising. The consequences include market losses for exporters of genuine goods and potential reputational damage for entire market segments. Nations who can help their exporters prove the authenticity of goods will enjoy a comparative advantage over those that do not.\n\n·  With annual carbon emissions at around 25 billion tons5 and with approximately 25 million people in forced labour, and 400 million tons of hazardous waste produced annually, there is a rapidly increasing consumer demand for sustainable products. Nations that can prove the sustainability of their exported goods through verifiable supply chain transparency will enjoy both higher prices for their goods and lower tariffs as importing nations start to penalize un-sustainable imports.\n\n·  With border authorities only able to inspect around 1% of around 1 billion sea containers8 and a much smaller proportion of 100 billion parcel shipments9 per year, the challenge of managing border risk against illicit goods and biosecurity threats has never been greater. Nations that can leverage high integrity data about import consignments can both increase seizures and facilitate legitimate imports. \n\nThe challenges described above are quite significant. Equally, the opportunities for nations that can address these challenges more effectively than their competitors are also significant. Digitisation is a key enabler of all strategies to address these challenges. Although many nations have made significant progress in digitizing trade processes within their borders such as implementing trade single windows, there remain significant challenges in digitizing cross-border processes.\n\nDiverse regulatory models and priorities across nations amplify the challenge. National policy making will reflect a complex mixture of market-oriented, security-oriented, rights-oriented, and domestic development-oriented priorities. These differences lead to problems of compatibility or interoperability among nations, and fragmentation of the digital space at the global level. Any scalable solution to the digitisation of cross border trade must embrace and not conflict with diverse policy making priorities.\n\nThis paper describes a highly scalable operating model for digitisation and trust of cross border trade based on verifiable credentials, linked data, and decentralised identifiers. It provides national regulators with implementation guidance that will facilitate the following outcomes.\n\n[**Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humans** ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sMxmWpWvx3IA7uvsUbXCDEi39K4NUOq5/view?usp=sharing)\n\nExperts say the rise of artificial intelligence will make most people better off over the next decade, but many have concerns about how advances in AI will affect what it means to be human, to be productive and to exercise free will\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SocialAttackVectors/CriminalActivity/ProxyAttacks/","title":"Proxy Attacks"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Proxy Attacks\n\nThe concept of 'Proxy Attacks' or 'attacks by proxy' is intended to refer to circumstances where an underlying attacker / bad actor; has enrolled others to perform an attack upon an intended victim, thereby seeking to remain undiscovered / secretly unable to be discovered and/or associated with the attack that is performed upon a target. \n\nThese sorts of attacks may incorporate various other activities that relates to persons knowingly involved in wrong-doing / crimes - whilst the actual attacker (the person committing the assults) may not be aware of the implications or circumstances of importance  relating to the pre-text of having been employed to commit an attack upon the target. \n\nIn the worst types of situations; these sorts of attacks can have a meaningful relationship to issues otherwise noted in the [[DigitalSlavery]] considerations, alongside those associated with [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]], notwithstanding broader associations with [[CommercialExploitation]], [[CriminalActivity]],  [[AttacksOnline]] and other [[CyberAttackVectors]], [[TemporalAttacks]], [[Torts]], [[Dehumanisation]] and just about anything else you can think of...\n\nIn-order to address the 'proxy attack' vectors; there needs to be a complex Human Centric AI Graph, that enables means for a court of law to lawfully seek information about the provonance of circumstances relating to harms that have been committed upon a person. \n\nAs far as i can recall, i am not aware of any situation where these sorts of methods have been employed that does not relate to the underlying actors seeking gainful outcomes, generally in relation to activities that seek to obtain or protect financial gains.

These attacks rely on exploiting the natural human tendency to trust and to want to help others, and they often target individuals who have access to sensitive information or systems.\n\nThere are several types of social engineering attacks, including:\n\n-   Phishing: This involves the use of fake emails or websites to trick people into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information.\n    \n-   Baiting: This involves offering something of value, such as access to exclusive content or a free gift, in order to entice people to reveal sensitive information or perform certain actions.\n    \n-   Scareware: This involves using fear or urgency to persuade people to take certain actions, such as installing software or clicking on a link.\n    \n-   Pretexting: This involves using a fake identity or pretext to gain access to sensitive information or systems.\n    \n-   Physical social engineering: This involves using face-to-face or phone interactions to trick people into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions.\n    \n\nSocial engineering attacks can be difficult to detect, as they often rely on psychological manipulation rather than technical vulnerabilities. It is important for individuals to be aware of the risks of social engineering attacks and to take steps to protect themselves from them, such as by being cautious about providing personal information or by verifying the identity of individuals before providing sensitive information.\n\nSome other common social engineering attacks include:\n\n-   Impersonation: This involves pretending to be someone else in order to gain access to sensitive information or systems. This can be done through phone calls, emails, or in person.\n    \n-   Quid pro quo: This involves offering something of value in exchange for sensitive information or access to systems.\n    \n-   Influence: This involves using persuasion techniques, such as flattery or authority, to convince people to reveal sensitive information or perform certain actions.\n    \n-   Diversion: This involves distracting people in order to obtain sensitive information or access to systems.\n    \n\nIt is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of these types of social engineering attacks and to take steps to protect themselves from them. This can include implementing security measures, such as two-factor authentication and strong passwords, and training employees to recognize and respond to social engineering attempts.\n\nOverall, social engineering attacks are a serious threat to individuals and organizations, as they can lead to the loss of sensitive information and damage to reputation and financial well-being.

Vulnerabilities: Tech debt can lead to vulnerabilities in the system, such as poor code quality or a lack of testing. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or take control of the system.\n    \n2.  Unpatched software: Tech debt can make it more difficult to keep software up to date with the latest security patches. This can leave systems open to known vulnerabilities that have already been fixed in more recent versions of the software.\n    \n3.  Outdated software: Tech debt can also make it more difficult to upgrade to newer versions of software, which may have better security features. This can leave systems open to newer threats that have emerged since the software was last updated.\n    \n4.  Lack of monitoring: Tech debt can make it more difficult to monitor systems for suspicious activity. This can make it harder to detect and respond to cyber attacks in a timely manner.\n    \n5.  Lack of compliance: Tech debt can make it difficult to comply with regulations and industry standards for data security. This can lead to fines and reputational damage for the organization.\n    \n6.  Difficulty in incident response: Tech debt can make it difficult to quickly detect a security incident and respond to it, which can prolong the incident and increase the damage caused by it.\n    \n7.  Difficulty in performing security testing: Tech debt can also make it difficult to perform security testing on systems and applications, as the complexity and lack of maintainability of the codebase can make it hard to identify vulnerabilities or simulate realistic attack scenarios.\n    \n8.  Difficulty in understanding the attack surface: Tech debt can make it difficult to understand the attack surface of the system, which can make it harder to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.\n    \n9.  Difficulty in implementing new security controls: Tech debt can make it difficult to implement new security controls, such as encryption or multi-factor authentication, as the complexity and lack of maintainability of the codebase can make it hard to integrate new features.\n    \n10.

Negligent misrepresentation torts are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation in that there is no [privity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privity \"Privity\") of contract; these torts are likely to involve [pure economic loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_economic_loss \"Pure economic loss\") which has been less-commonly recoverable in tort. One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the \"foreseeability\" doctrine.[35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-47) The economic loss rule is highly confusing and inconsistently applied[36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-48) and began in 1965 from a California case involving strict liability for product defects; in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the doctrine in _East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Deleval, Inc_.[37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-:0-49) In 2010, the [supreme court of the U.S. state of Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Supreme_Court \"Washington Supreme Court\") replaced the economic loss doctrine with an \"independent duty doctrine\".[38](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-50)\n\nEconomic antitrust torts have been somewhat submerged by modern [competition law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law \"Competition law\"). However, in the United States, private parties are permitted in certain circumstances to sue for anticompetitive practices, including under federal or state statutes or on the basis of common law [tortious interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interference \"Tortious interference\"), which may be based upon the [Restatement (Second) of Torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restatement_of_Torts,_Second \"Restatement of Torts, Second\") §766.[39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-51)\n\nNegligent misrepresentation as tort where no contractual [privity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privity \"Privity\") exists was disallowed in England by _[Derry v Peek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_v_Peek \"Derry v Peek\")_ [1889]; however, this position was overturned in _[Hedley Byrne v Heller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedley_Byrne_v_Heller \"Hedley Byrne v Heller\")_ in 1964 so that such actions were allowed if a \"special relationship\" existed between the plaintiff and defendant.[40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Ballam-52) United States courts and scholars \"paid lip-service\" to _Derry_; however, scholars such as [William Prosser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Prosser_(academic) \"William Prosser (academic)\") argued that it was misinterpreted by English courts.[40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Ballam-52) The case of _[Ultramares Corporation v. Touche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramares_Corporation_v._Touche \"Ultramares Corporation v. Touche\")_ (1932) limited the liability of an [auditor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditor \"Auditor\") to known identified beneficiaries of the audit and this rule was widely applied in the United States until the 1960s.[40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Ballam-52) The [Restatement (Second) of Torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restatement_of_Torts,_Second \"Restatement of Torts, Second\") expanded liability to \"foreseeable\" users rather than specifically identified \"foreseen\" users of the information, dramatically expanding liability and affecting professionals such as accountants, architects, attorneys, and [surveyors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying \"Surveying\").[40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Ballam-52) As of 1989, most U.S. jurisdictions follow either the _Ultramares_ approach or the Restatement approach.[40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Ballam-52)\n\nThe [tort of deceit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_of_deceit \"Tort of deceit\") for inducement into a contract is a tort in English law, but in practice has been replaced by actions under [Misrepresentation Act 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrepresentation_Act_1967 \"Misrepresentation Act 1967\").[41](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-53) In the United States, similar torts existed but have become superseded to some degree by contract law and the pure economic loss rule.[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54) Historically (and to some degree today), fraudulent (but not negligent[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54)) misrepresentation involving damages for economic loss may be awarded under the \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" rule (damages identical to [expectation damages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_damages \"Expectation damages\") in contracts[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54)) which awards the plaintiff the difference between the value represented and the actual value.[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54) Beginning with _Stiles v. White_ (1846) in Massachusetts, this rule spread across the country as a majority rule with the \"out-of-pocket damages\" rule as a minority rule.[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54) Although the damages under the \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" are described as compensatory, the plaintiff is left better off than before the transaction.[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54) Since the economic loss rule would eliminate these benefits if applied strictly, there is an exception to allow the misrepresentation tort if not related to a contract.[42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Lens2011-54)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SocialAttackVectors/Torts/IntentionalTorts/","title":"Intentional Torts"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Intentional Torts\n\nSource: Wikipedia.\n\nIntentional torts are any intentional acts that are reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to an individual, and that do so.

Those commonly recognised include trespass to land, trespass to chattels (personal property), and conversion.\n-   Dignitary torts are a category of intentional tort affecting the honour, dignity, and reputation of an individual and include: [Defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation \"Defamation\")[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-41), [invasion of privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_privacy \"Invasion of privacy\"), [breach of confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_confidence \"Breach of confidence\"), torts related to the justice system such as [malicious prosecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_prosecution \"Malicious prosecution\") and [abuse of process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_process \"Abuse of process\"), and torts pertaining to sexual relations that are considered obsolete in most common law jurisdictions such as [alienation of affection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affection \"Alienation of affection\") and [criminal conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conversation \"Criminal conversation\").\n\nAn intentional tort requires an overt act, some form of intent, and causation. In most cases, transferred intent, which occurs when the defendant intends to injure an individual but actually ends up injuring another individual, will satisfy the intent requirement.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-42) Causation can be satisfied as long as the defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SocialAttackVectors/Torts/Nuisance/","title":"Nuisance"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Source: Wikipedia\n\n\"Nuisance\" is traditionally used to describe an activity which is harmful or annoying to others such as indecent conduct or a rubbish heap. Nuisances either affect private individuals (private nuisance) or the general public (public nuisance). The claimant can sue for most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land. In English law, whether activity was an illegal nuisance depended upon the area and whether the activity was \"for the benefit of the commonwealth\", with richer areas subject to a greater expectation of cleanliness and quiet.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Nuisance-43) The case _Jones v Powell_ (1629) provides an early example, in which a person's professional papers were damaged by the vapors of a neighboring brewery. Although the outcome of this case is unclear,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Nuisance-43) Whitelocke of the [Court of the King's Bench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_King%27s_Bench_(England) \"Court of King's Bench (England)\") is recorded as saying that since the water supply in area was already contaminated, the nuisance was not actionable as it is \"better that they should be spoiled than that the commonwealth stand in need of good liquor\".[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nIn English law, a related category of tort liability was created in the case of _[Rylands v Fletcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rylands_v_Fletcher \"Rylands v Fletcher\")_ (1868): strict liability was established for a dangerous escape of some hazard, including water, fire, or animals as long as the cause was not remote. In _[Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Water_Co_Ltd_v_Eastern_Counties_Leather_plc \"Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc\")_ (1994), chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's water reservoirs.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-ElworthyHolder-44) The _Rylands_ rule remains in use in England and Wales.

In order to win an action for negligence, a plaintiff must prove: duty, breach of duty, causation, scope of liability, and damages. Further, a defendant may assert various defences to a plaintiff’s case, including comparative fault and assumption of risk. Negligence is a tort which arises from the breach of the [duty of care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care \"Duty of care\") owed by one person to another from the perspective of a [reasonable person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person \"Reasonable person\"). Although credited as appearing in the United States in _[Brown v. Kendall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Kendall \"Brown v. Kendall\")_, the later Scottish case of _[Donoghue v Stevenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donoghue_v_Stevenson \"Donoghue v Stevenson\")_ [1932] AC 562, followed in England, brought England into line with the United States and established the 'tort of negligence' as opposed to negligence as a component in specific actions.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-31) In _Donoghue_, Mrs. Donoghue drank from an opaque bottle containing a decomposed snail and claimed that it had made her ill. She could not sue Mr. Stevenson for damages for breach of contract and instead sued for negligence. The majority determined that the definition of negligence can be divided into four component parts that the plaintiff must prove to establish negligence.\n\nIn most common law jurisdictions, there are four elements to a negligence action:[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-32)\n\n1.  duty: the [defendant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant \"Defendant\") has a duty to others, including the [plaintiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff \"Plaintiff\"), to [exercise reasonable care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care \"Duty of care\")[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-34)\n2.  breach: the defendant breaches that duty through an act or culpable omission\n3.  damages: as a result of that act or omission, the plaintiff suffers an injury\n4.  causation: the injury to the plaintiff is a reasonably foreseeable[[i]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-36) consequence of the defendant's act or omission under the [proximate cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_cause \"Proximate cause\") doctrine.[[j]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-39)\n\nSome jurisdictions narrow the definition down to three elements: duty, breach and proximately caused harm.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-owen-40) Some jurisdictions recognize five elements, duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause, and damages.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-owen-40) However, at their heart, the various definitions of what constitutes negligent conduct are very similar. Depending on jurisdiction, [product liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_liability \"Product liability\") cases such as those involving warranties may be considered negligence actions or fall under a separate category of [strict liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_liability \"Strict liability\") torts. Similarly, cases involving environmental or consumer health torts which other countries treat as negligence or strict liability torts are treated in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_law_in_India \"Tort law in India\") as [absolute liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_liability \"Absolute liability\") torts.\n\nIn establishing whether a duty of care exists, different common law jurisdictions have developed a variety of distinct but related approaches, with many jurisdictions building on the test established in _[Anns v Merton LBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anns_v_Merton_LBC \"Anns v Merton LBC\")_. In Singapore, the current leading case is _[Spandeck Engineering v Defence Science and Technology Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandeck_Engineering_v_Defence_Science_and_Technology_Agency \"Spandeck Engineering v Defence Science and Technology Agency\")_, which builds on _Anns_ by establishing a two step test comprising an analysis of [proximate cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_cause \"Proximate cause\") and [public policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy_doctrine \"Public policy doctrine\") as a universal test, independent from the individual circumstances of a given case, for determining the existence of a duty of care. The Supreme Court of Canada established a similar test in the context of assessing damages for [pure economic loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_economic_loss \"Pure economic loss\") owing to negligence derived from _Anns_ which consists of a two step examination of the existence of a sufficiently proximate relationship between the parties and public policy considerations; however, the Canadian test is more sensitive to the individual circumstances of a given case and the first step is generally deemed to be met where a case falls into one of three [sets of circumstances recognised by precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_tort_law#Negligence \"Canadian tort law\") while the Singaporean test is independent of precedent. In English tort law, _[Caparo Industries plc v Dickman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caparo_Industries_plc_v_Dickman \"Caparo Industries plc v Dickman\")_ established a tripartite test for the existence of a duty of care per which harm must be reasonably foreseeable as a potential result of the defendant's conduct; the parties must be in a relationship of proximity; and it must be fair, just, and reasonable to impose such a duty."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/HostServiceRequirements/MediaProcessing/ffmpeg/","title":"Ffmpeg"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://ffmpeg.org/\n\nhttps://pkg.go.dev/search?q=ffmpeg\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/HostServiceRequirements/MediaProcessing/opencv/","title":"Opencv"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://gocv.io/\n\nhttps://opencv.org/"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/HyperMediaContainers/Webizen3.0Apps/Webizen-Connect/","title":"Webizen-Connect"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Webizen Connect is a term that denotes a concept of Connecting, parsing and integrating APIs from other platforms (ie: web2 silos). \n\nExamples are;\n\n- [SocialMediaAPIs](SocialMediaAPIs.md).\n- [[DataApplications]]\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/HyperMediaContainers/Webizen3.0Apps/DesignGoals/","title":"Design Goals"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Design Goals\n\nThe objective of this project is to create a runtime environment for the use of RWW / solid like applications that are built using HTML5 (HTML/CSS/JS) on personal computers.  The focus of the first stage is to deliver an ecosystem that operates on laptop & desktop machines, with the support of a low-cost server (or server-side service) that provides networking support and related features built upon the tailscale / headscale networking packages.\n\nThe use of obsidian is experimental and these product / functionality specifications are likely to be updated overtime. \n\n**HIGH LEVEL OBJECTIVES**\n\nThe high-level objective, is to create some initial open-source software packages, that provide an ability for users to either download a server-runtime that can be set-up on a VPS to support private networking support with 'client' applications that are installable on Windows & OSX in particular (also linux, but not the priority); or, that the user is able to use the 'webizen' / webcivics install that is set-up to support users.\n\nUsers then download the 'client' apps, and set them up on their local machine (ie: OSX/Windows/linux) which in-turn provides them a folder they can drop HTML5 apps written for that 'webizen server' that uses WebID-TLS (from the local host rww server) and optionally also WebID-OIDC (via the remote host / 'control server').  \n\nThe client apps are able to be written using basic HTML5 tools; and the server provides the basic 'hooks' needed to perform various functions  (described later).\n\nThe instances use semantic web technologies to create decentralised 'social' application environments.  ACLs are managed by the user, via WebID related ACLs; which are in-turn built upon the namespace (entity centric).  Local apps do not provide any data to 3rd party systems unless expressly requested to do so.  This mechanism is sought to be achieved using 'verifiable credentials' (or openbadges) related methods (alongside WAC).   The more advanced aspects of how these systems should be implemented requires an operating environment that has some apps functioning on it, in-order to further develop the semantic logic processes. \n\nIn-order to achieve that objective quickly; a method has been identified to use (and update accordingly) existing go libraries - as to achieve the objective of building a basic environment that is able to be used by people who are not necessarily software engineers (ie: might have various types of skills that are important for progress); and, until there is something that operates in a manner that exemplifies how these systems are intending to create a different sort of ecosystem, its hard to explain. \n\nNOTE:  One of the first projects sought to be developed (after the basics are done) is a 'work platform' or app / ecosystem environment. The purpose of this 'app' / ecosystem environment; is to support decentralised development of projects, including the means to attribute resource value (project costs) which may in-turn articulate to future income (roi / compensation); using dual-licensing and other complex methods, as to support the competing interests of seeking to end-up providing open and freely available software for the betterment of mankind; whilst ensuring the method employed to do so, does not breach human rights / engender 'digital slavery'.  This project is about getting long-term works to a next milestone; and one / if that is achieved, then there is still a long way to go.\n\nOUTCOME\nThe outcomes of this project seek to achieve the following objectives;\n1. Users should be able to 'sign-up' online; and,\n\ta. create an WebID-OIDC Address; and,\n\tb. connect a domainname (or are alternatively provided one)\n\tc. be provided a basic webspace (html5) that can use local graph resources.\n3. Install 'clients' that create a networking environment that supports HTTPS & WebID-TLS using that domainname.\n4. Create and/or download/install 'webizen v1 apps' (rww/solid based) onto their 'home' webizen server/client.\n\nOnce these objectives are achieved, it is considered that users will be able to 'push' resources (different acls, etc.) to different nodes (ie: from their local machine, to the 'host' that's supporting some sort of 'public webpage', blog, etc.); and that this is achieved via the 'apps' that are created on top of this 'webizen v1 platform' stack.\n\nDevelopment Tools Summary\n\nPrimary Codebase\nIn-order to develop something that works quickly, it has been found that a number of  critical functionality requirements is able to be supported by existing GoLang projects.  Alternatives have not been found using nodejs libraries or otherwise.\n\nThese libraries include; but are not limited to,\n\nClient / Server Side Packages\n\nHeadscale (https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) \nHeadscale is an opensource implementation of the TailScale Control Server.  It provides an ability for users to set-up an account via OIDC (openID connect) and initiate a private network based upon the tailscale network technologies; that can then be routed both privately and publically, using an 'exit node'\n\nTailscale (https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale) \nTailscale provides both client and server packages for networking.  It provides a private network that supports TLS & IPv4/IPv6; enabling routing through firewalls (like a vpn).  It is controlled by a 'control server', headscale is an open-source project working to build one.\n\nCaddy Server (https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)\nCaddy Server is an extensible web-server written in Go.  It is integrated with Tailscale.\n\nRWW Server\nIn the project now commonly known as solid, however earlier known as RWW (or crosscloud) there was a server implementation in GOlang. \nGOLD ( https://github.com/linkeddata/gold )\n\nAnother library (unknown level of development) called helix (https://github.com/deiu/helix) also exists. \n\n**Other libraries**\nThere's an array of other libraries that may be usefully employed and/or considered from an architectual point of view for future releases.  This does include; in-particular,\n- Graph Database libraries (NB: https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley)\n- Credentials / Verifiable Credentials (nb: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/pkg/doc/verifiable )\n\nThis is a non-exhaustive list and more information / research about the options is being compiled into this documentation environment."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/HostServiceRequirements/DatabaseRequirements/Database Alternatives/BadWolf/","title":"Bad Wolf"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Bad Wolf\n\n\nWebsite: http://google.github.io/badwolf/\n\nGit Repo link: https://github.com/google/badwolf\nDriver: https://github.com/google/badwolf-drivers\n\nBadWolf is a GoLang solution.  \n\nDescription from [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/google/badwolf):\n\n*BadWolf is a temporal graph store loosely modeled after the concepts introduced by the [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework). It presents a flexible storage abstraction, efficient query language, and data-interchange model for representing a directed graph that accommodates the storage and linking of arbitrary objects without the need for a rigid schema.*\n\n*BadWolf began as a [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore), but triples have been expanded to quads to allow simpler and flexible temporal reasoning. Because BadWolf is designed for generalized relationship storage, most of the web-related idiosyncrasies of RDF are not used and have been toned down or directly removed and focuses on its time reasoning aspects.*\n\n*In case you are curious about the name, BadWolf is named after the [BadWolf entity](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Bad_Wolf_(entity)) as it appeared in Dr. Who series episode _\"The Parting Of Ways\"_ after Rose Tyler looked into the Time Vortex itself. The BadWolf entity scattered events in time as self encode messages, creating a looped ontological paradox. Hence, naming a temporal graph store after the entity seemed appropriate.*\n\nVideo: \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9c2HAwnVA9k\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/HostServiceRequirements/DatabaseRequirements/Database Alternatives/Apache Kafka/","title":"INTRODUCTION"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nContent Sourced from the  [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) Website (link also provided),\n\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nEverything you need to know about Kafka in 10 minutes : \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FKgi3n-FyNU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n#### [Apache Kafka® is an event streaming platform. What does that mean?](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_platform)\nKafka combines three key capabilities so you can implement [your use cases](https://kafka.apache.org/powered-by) for event streaming end-to-end with a single battle-tested solution:\n\n1.  To **publish** (write) and **subscribe to** (read) streams of events, including continuous import/export of your data from other systems.\n2.  To **store** streams of events durably and reliably for as long as you want.\n3.  To **process** streams of events as they occur or retrospectively.\n\nAnd all this functionality is provided in a distributed, highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, and secure manner. Kafka can be deployed on bare-metal hardware, virtual machines, and containers, and on-premises as well as in the cloud. You can choose between self-managing your Kafka environments and using fully managed services offered by a variety of vendors.\n\n#### [](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_nutshell)[How does Kafka work in a nutshell?](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_nutshell)\n\nKafka is a distributed system consisting of **servers** and **clients** that communicate via a high-performance [TCP network protocol](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html). It can be deployed on bare-metal hardware, virtual machines, and containers in on-premise as well as cloud environments.\n\n**Servers**: Kafka is run as a cluster of one or more servers that can span multiple datacenters or cloud regions. Some of these servers form the storage layer, called the brokers. Other servers run [Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect) to continuously import and export data as event streams to integrate Kafka with your existing systems such as relational databases as well as other Kafka clusters. To let you implement mission-critical use cases, a Kafka cluster is highly scalable and fault-tolerant: if any of its servers fails, the other servers will take over their work to ensure continuous operations without any data loss.\n\n**Clients**: They allow you to write distributed applications and microservices that read, write, and process streams of events in parallel, at scale, and in a fault-tolerant manner even in the case of network problems or machine failures. Kafka ships with some such clients included, which are augmented by [dozens of clients](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients) provided by the Kafka community: clients are available for Java and Scala including the higher-level [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) library, for Go, Python, C/C++, and many other programming languages as well as REST APIs.\n\n#### [What is event streaming?](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_streaming)\n\nEvent streaming is the digital equivalent of the human body's central nervous system. It is the technological foundation for the 'always-on' world where businesses are increasingly software-defined and automated, and where the user of software is more software.\n\nTechnically speaking, event streaming is the practice of capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams of events; storing these event streams durably for later retrieval; manipulating, processing, and reacting to the event streams in real-time as well as retrospectively; and routing the event streams to different destination technologies as needed. Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time.\n\n#### [](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_usage)[What can I use event streaming for?](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_usage)\n\nEvent streaming is applied to a [wide variety of use cases](https://kafka.apache.org/powered-by) across a plethora of industries and organizations. Its many examples include:\n\n-   To process payments and financial transactions in real-time, such as in stock exchanges, banks, and insurances.\n-   To track and monitor cars, trucks, fleets, and shipments in real-time, such as in logistics and the automotive industry.\n-   To continuously capture and analyze sensor data from IoT devices or other equipment, such as in factories and wind parks.\n-   To collect and immediately react to customer interactions and orders, such as in retail, the hotel and travel industry, and mobile applications.\n-   To monitor patients in hospital care and predict changes in condition to ensure timely treatment in emergencies.\n-   To connect, store, and make available data produced by different divisions of a company.\n-   To serve as the foundation for data platforms, event-driven architectures, and microservices.\n\n\n#### [](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_concepts_and_terms)[Main Concepts and Terminology](https://kafka.apache.org/intro#intro_concepts_and_terms)\n\nAn **event** records the fact that \"something happened\" in the world or in your business. It is also called record or message in the documentation. When you read or write data to Kafka, you do this in the form of events. Conceptually, an event has a key, value, timestamp, and optional metadata headers. Here's an example event:\n\n-   Event key: \"Alice\"\n-   Event value: \"Made a payment of $200 to Bob\"\n-   Event timestamp: \"Jun. 25, 2020 at 2:06 p.m.\"\n\n**Producers** are those client applications that publish (write) events to Kafka, and **consumers** are those that subscribe to (read and process) these events. In Kafka, producers and consumers are fully decoupled and agnostic of each other, which is a key design element to achieve the high scalability that Kafka is known for. For example, producers never need to wait for consumers. Kafka provides various [guarantees](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics) such as the ability to process events exactly-once.\n\nEvents are organized and durably stored in **topics**. Very simplified, a topic is similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the files in that folder. An example topic name could be \"payments\". Topics in Kafka are always multi-producer and multi-subscriber: a topic can have zero, one, or many producers that write events to it, as well as zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to these events. Events in a topic can be read as often as needed—unlike traditional messaging systems, events are not deleted after consumption. Instead, you define for how long Kafka should retain your events through a per-topic configuration setting, after which old events will be discarded. Kafka's performance is effectively constant with respect to data size, so storing data for a long time is perfectly fine.\n\nTopics are **partitioned**, meaning a topic is spread over a number of \"buckets\" located on different Kafka brokers. This distributed placement of your data is very important for scalability because it allows client applications to both read and write the data from/to many brokers at the same time. When a new event is published to a topic, it is actually appended to one of the topic's partitions. Events with the same event key (e.g., a customer or vehicle ID) are written to the same partition, and Kafka [guarantees](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics) that any consumer of a given topic-partition will always read that partition's events in exactly the same order as they were written.\n\n![](https://kafka.apache.org/images/streams-and-tables-p1_p4.png)\n\nFigure: This example topic has four partitions P1–P4. Two different producer clients are publishing, independently from each other, new events to the topic by writing events over the network to the topic's partitions. Events with the same key (denoted by their color in the figure) are written to the same partition. Note that both producers can write to the same partition if appropriate.\n\nTo make your data fault-tolerant and highly-available, every topic can be **replicated**, even across geo-regions or datacenters, so that there are always multiple brokers that have a copy of the data just in case things go wrong, you want to do maintenance on the brokers, and so on. A common production setting is a replication factor of 3, i.e., there will always be three copies of your data. This replication is performed at the level of topic-partitions.\n\nThis primer should be sufficient for an introduction. The [Design](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#design) section of the documentation explains Kafka's various concepts in full detail, if you are interested.\n \nSource: [apache kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Notes/RelatedProjects/PCT-Webizen-Notes/Webizen/HostServiceRequirements/DatabaseRequirements/Database Alternatives/CayleyGraph/","title":"CayleyGraph"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Cayley is an open-source database for [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data).
