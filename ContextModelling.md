There's a few topics.

#### Spatiotemporal Social informatics
The development of languages is contextual.  It is not simply about the words in an otherwise isolated context.  Rather, the meanings have spatio-temporal relations.

In-order to support the 'training' process for AI systems, to be provided socio-temporal contexts the informatics need to be defined; rather than otherwise simply 'assumed'... 

### Agent Flags

Different AI systems are better for different things.  There are various examples being illustrated presently, where large language models are generating errors when prompted to provide caculations relating to math. 

Whereas any caculator can do the job properly.  so, functionally, the illustrations suggest either that they're intentionally being corrupted; or that, its not exporting the request to a model (program) that's better suited to do the task.
