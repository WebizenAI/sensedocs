# British Latin

**British Latin** or **British Vulgar Latin** was the [Vulgar Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgar_Latin "Vulgar Latin") spoken in [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain") in the [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain "Roman Britain") and [sub-Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Roman_Britain "Sub-Roman Britain") periods. While Britain formed part of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"), Latin became the principal language of the elite, especially in the more romanized south and east of the island. However, in the less romanized north and west it never substantially replaced the [Brittonic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Brittonic "Common Brittonic") of the indigenous [Britons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britons_(Celtic_people) "Britons (Celtic people)"). In recent years, scholars have debated the extent to which British Latin was distinguishable from its continental counterparts, which developed into the [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages").

After the [end of Roman rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_Roman_rule_in_Britain "End of Roman rule in Britain"), Latin was displaced as a spoken language by [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") in most of what became [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England") during the [Anglo-Saxon settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_settlement_of_Britain "Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain") of the fifth and sixth centuries. It survived in the remaining Celtic regions of western Britain but died out in those regions too by about 700, when it was replaced by the local [Brittonic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittonic_languages "Brittonic languages").
