# Linguist List

There is clearly an enormous amount of information on this site.  There is a LinguistList index code for most if not all languages.

Some select information has been copied from the wikipedia article about it, per below.

The **LINGUIST List** is a major online resource for the academic field of [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"). It was founded by [Anthony Aristar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Aristar "Anthony Aristar") in early 1990 at the [University of Western Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia "University of Western Australia"),[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-1) and is used as a reference by the [National Science Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation "National Science Foundation") in the United States.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-2) Its main and oldest feature is the premoderated [electronic mailing list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list "Electronic mailing list"), now with thousands of subscribers all over the world, where queries and their summarised results, discussions, journal table of contents, dissertation abstracts, calls for papers, book and conference announcements, software notices and other useful pieces of linguistic information are posted.

### Projects

The LINGUIST List has been one of the resources for the creation of the new [ISO 639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3 "ISO 639-3") language identification standard (aiming to classify all known languages with an alpha-3 [language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_code "Language code")).[11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-11) While the [Ethnologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnologue "Ethnologue") was used as the resource for [natural languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language") currently in use, Linguist List has provided the information on historic varieties, ancient languages, [international auxiliary languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_languages "Auxiliary languages") and [constructed languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language "Constructed language").

The LINGUIST List has also received grants for

-   the Catalogue of Endangered Languages project, a joint effort with the [University of Hawai'i at Manoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hawai%27i_at_Manoa "University of Hawai'i at Manoa") to build the most reliable, up-to-date source of information on the world's endangered languages[12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-12)
-   the EMELD Project, designed to build infrastructure to facilitate the preservation of endangered languages data
-   the DATA project, designed to digitise data for the [Dena'ina language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dena%27ina_language "Dena'ina language")[13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-13)
-   the LL-MAP project (defunct), designed to produce a comprehensive [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS "GIS") site for language;[14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-14)
-   the MultiTree project (defunct), designed to produce a complete database and tree-viewing facility to study language relationships[15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-15)[16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-16)
-   the AARDVARC project, designed to address the problem of not transcribed, and therefore unavailable, documentation of understudied languages by building an interdisciplinary community of linguists, anthropologists, and computer scientists to share knowledge and collaborate on the specification of a repository and suite of tools to facilitate automatic or semi-automatic transcription and analysis of audio and visual information[17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-17)

The EMELD project[18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-18) was the instigator of the [GOLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOLD_(ontology) "GOLD (ontology)") [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(computer_science) "Ontology (computer science)"), the furthest advanced of the current attempts to build an ontology for the [morphosyntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphosyntax "Morphosyntax") of linguistic data.[19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-19) It has also produced a [phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics "Phonetics") ontology, based upon [Peter Ladefoged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ladefoged "Peter Ladefoged")'s and [Ian Maddieson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Maddieson "Ian Maddieson")'s _[The Sounds of the World's Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sounds_of_the_World%27s_Languages "The Sounds of the World's Languages")_.

Some projects emerged from funded or internal activities at LINGUIST List:

-   GeoLing, a [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS "GIS")-based information service that places events, jobs, institutions, conferences, and other announcements with a geo-location that are announced on LINGUIST List on the global map.[20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-20)
-   AskALing, a discussion forum and question and answer platform for linguistically relevant questions and issues.[21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-21)
-   GORILLA, a platform for archiving of language data, recordings, word lists, corpora, and technologies, and the development and conversion of language data to corpora and resources that bridge language documentation of low-resourced and endangered languages, and [Human Language Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Language_Technology "Human Language Technology") (HLT) and [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Language_Processing "Natural Language Processing") (NLP).[22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguist_List#cite_note-22)

### Software tools

-   [ELAN2split](https://bitbucket.org/dcavar/elan2split), (C) 2015-2016 by [Damir Cavar](https://linguistlist.org/people/damir_cavar.html):  
    This is a free and open curse implementation of a segmenter for ELAN files written in C++11 and platform independent. Using this tool one can select any tier in an [ELAN](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) Annotation File and generate file-pairs of audio segment and corresponding transcription all annotated time intervals. These segments of audio and transcription can be used to train common Forced Alignment tools, e.g. the Penn Forced Aligner, the [Prosodylab-Aligner](http://prosodylab.org/tools/aligner/), or or the [MAUS Segmenter](http://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/research/current_projects/maus_en.html). A set of binaries is available on the [Bitbucket project page](https://bitbucket.org/dcavar/elan2split/downloads). The code of ELAN2split is free and open source. [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) is a prerequisite.  
    Please contact us, if you need a binary for your project or system.

-   Espeak language models for Text-to-Speech, (C) 2015 by [Lwin Moe](https://linguistlist.org/people/lwin.html), [Andrew Lamont](https://linguistlist.org/people/andrew_lamont.html), [Damir Cavar](https://linguistlist.org/people/damir_cavar.html), [Malgorzata E. Cavar](https://linguistlist.org/people/malgosia_cavar.html):  
    This is a collection of [Espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) language models for Text-to-Speech. These models were developed to serve as plugins in the [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)-based Forced Alignment implementation. The [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)-based implementation uses [Espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) to generate audio from text and forced align transcriptions. We develop models for different low-resourced and endangered languages to serve in [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)-based forced alignment.
-   [TreebankParser SA](https://bitbucket.org/dcavar/treebankparsersa/overview) is a small tool to extract rules from treebanks that use the Penn Treebank notation. It generates relative or absolute frequency profiles for the extracted rules. It is part of the [Free Linguistic Environment](https://gorilla.linguistlist.org/fle/) ([FLE](https://gorilla.linguistlist.org/fle/)) project.
