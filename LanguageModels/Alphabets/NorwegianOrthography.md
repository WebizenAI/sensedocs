**Norwegian orthography** is the method of writing the [Norwegian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language "Norwegian language"), of which there are two written standards: [Bokmål](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokm%C3%A5l "Bokmål") and [Nynorsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nynorsk "Nynorsk"). While Bokmål has for the most part derived its forms from the written Danish language and [Danish-Norwegian speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dano-Norwegian "Dano-Norwegian"), Nynorsk gets its word forms from [Aasen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_Aasen "Ivar Aasen") reconstructed "base dialect", which is intended to represent the distinctive dialectal forms. Both standards use a 29-letter variant of the [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet") and the same orthographic principles.
