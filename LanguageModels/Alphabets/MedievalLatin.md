**Medieval Latin** was the form of [Literary Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_Latin "Literary Latin") used in [Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church") [Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe "Western Europe") during the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). In this region it served as the primary written language, though local languages were also written to varying degrees. Latin functioned as the main medium of scholarly exchange, as the [liturgical language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgical_language "Liturgical language") of the [Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church"), and as the working language of science, literature, law, and administration.
