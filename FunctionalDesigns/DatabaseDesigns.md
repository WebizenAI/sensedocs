## Database

A Graph database needs to be used to store the vocabulary models and related datasets.  The preference is to use a quad-store, that can in-turn store the information provided by different datasets in a format that is structurally defined to be associated with whatever source / dataset it came from.

The Database should also support both temporal and geospatial informatics.  The ability for the 'knowledge store' to be able to be provided additional information from various sources to improve the model is a usefully important functional requirement.
