**OpenCV** (**Open Source Computer Vision Library**) is a [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing) "Library (computing)") of programming functions mainly for [real-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing "Real-time computing") [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision").[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV#cite_note-1) Originally developed by [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel "Intel"), it was later supported by [Willow Garage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_Garage "Willow Garage"), then Itseez (which was later acquired by Intel[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV#cite_note-2)). The library is [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform "Cross-platform") and licensed as [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software") under [Apache License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License "Apache License") 2. Starting in 2011, OpenCV features GPU acceleration for real-time operations.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV#cite_note-3)
