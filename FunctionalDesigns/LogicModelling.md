# Logic Modelling

There are a few parts to the modelling technique.

1. instructive
2. generative
3. regenerative
4. Inferencing
5. Adaptive
6. Quorum based alterations & related changes.

A framework needs to be defined to clearly define how outputs have been produced.

One of the objectives, is to try to thoughtfully design the top-level ontology to be as accurate and minimal as possible.  I have a concern (perhaps misplaced) that the use of OWL:Thing as a primary prefix, has led to various negative unintended consequences.

There are a number of alternative candidates including but not limited to;

- RDFS
- RIF
- SHACL
- CogAI

The logic model is likely to benefit from the addition of mathematical and algebraic vocabularies, that may then be used functionally.  This is in addition the use addition of vocabulary relating to datatypes and data structures.  IT may be useful to be able to add software language vocabularies also.  

A question that is as yet unanswered, is whether and/or how, the base language model can be defined; perhaps generatively, and/or through the use of back-propagation models or simliar; and then, make use of that existing software as a toolset for producing logic vocabularies / interfaces...
