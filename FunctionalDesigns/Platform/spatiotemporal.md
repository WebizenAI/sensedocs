## Strabon
https://strabon.di.uoa.gr/home.html

Strabon is built by extending the well-known RDF store [Sesame (now called RDF4J)](http://rdf4j.org/) and extends RDF4J’s components to manage thematic, spatial and temporal data that is stored in the backend RDBMS.

(note: implication is that SparqlMM was originally built for that platform also).
