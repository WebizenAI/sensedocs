One way or another, a means to quickly obtain records is absolutely helpful.  The amount of time it takes currently, is far more significant than is considered to be desirable. 

There are two methods considered potentially feasible,the first is a browser plugin, the second is a browser.

A browser plugin would be usefully helpful, although there are concerns that the methods required end-up providing a demand to produce a browser-product, rather than just a plugin.  perhaps the answer will end-up being 'both'.
