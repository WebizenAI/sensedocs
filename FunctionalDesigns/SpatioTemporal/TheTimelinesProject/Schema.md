#### NLP - Semantic Enrichment
semantic enrichment is a process where natural language used in documents, etc. can be processed to identify key-words, and associate them to defined meanings in a structured informatics manner.  This in-turn requires ontology; whilst the sense project seeks to produce a new ontological method, the existing systems are built upon [lod-cloud](https://lod-cloud.net/) ontologies. 

As the use of sense is intended to support 'backwards compatibility' with semweb (lod-cloud, etc); this will in-turn create a predicate requirement to support means for testing these features and systems.

An example of semantic enrichment can be found: https://wordlift.io/how-it-works/

### Financial Calcs
The ability to add / associate financial calcs.

### Energy Calcs
The means to apply / associate energy caculations is enormously important.  This is supplimentry to known financial caculations and models that can / could otherwise be applied.

### Attention calcs

Attention calcs are more complex. the general gist of the consideration / deliberation, is to form a method to try to evaluate the amount of human attention that has been provided to a particular topic // concept, etc.  which both helps to evaluate the cost & productivity assessment criteria for good policy vs. bad policy and/or activities, or at large, attention.
