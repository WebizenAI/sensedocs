### Wikipedia Description

**Optical character recognition** or **optical character reader** (**OCR**) is the [electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics") or [mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine "Machine") conversion of [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image "Image") of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition#cite_note-1)

Widely used as a form of [data entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_entry "Data entry") from printed paper data records – whether passport documents, invoices, [bank statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_statement "Bank statement"), computerized receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation – it is a common method of digitizing printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as [cognitive computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_computing "Cognitive computing"), [machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation "Machine translation"), (extracted) [text-to-speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-speech "Text-to-speech"), key data and [text mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining "Text mining"). OCR is a field of research in [pattern recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition "Pattern recognition"), [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision").
