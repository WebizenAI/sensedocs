# Language Models

This series of notes refers to the inputs and related considerations.  

The formal knowledge modellings of 'natural language', in a comprehensive manner, is a fairly complex endevour.  The reason why the complexities are being explored in-detail is in response to a belief or hypothesis, is that the need to get stuck into the detail will have meaningful consequential effects upon the qualities associated with the use of AI that depends upon some form of language construct.  The challenge becomes producing an informatics ecosystem that is reliably able to intepret the meaning and provonance of words.
