# Notes

This folder is intended to contain some initial notes to get a bearing on the objective purpose, requirements, functionality, etc. 

## Sense

Sense seeks to be a construct that provides an understanding of the English vocabulary. It should employ a range of structured language datasets and services, particularly employing those that have been produced using RDF.  It should also consume various stem language datasets, both written, oral and pictorial. The model should be able to generate derivative vocabulary models.

Whilst the primary language focus is presently English, the addition of geospatial and temporal provenance information of information that is known about the history of words, phrases and their meanings will require the model to be trained against an array of other language datasets.  

The model should be able to be distributed online using a DLT protocol, such as some form of DHT based method - that may well include the use of GIT or guneco.  it is important that the system is designed to preserve privacy.  how people communicate either in written, typed or spoken form in private circumstances is a private matter; and any social circumstances must employ clearly defined terms.

The system should also be adaptive and generative, perhaps employing a network of models that interoperable perform personal generative processing with both clear declarative and procedural semantics; in addition to clearly labelled inferences.

The model should be able to be trained to be able to be used in a variety of contexts, including but not limited to:

    * Dictionary and Spellcheck
    * Ontology Production
    * Ontology Reasoning
    * Search
    * Database Queries
    * Database Structures
    * Content Metadata Generation
    * Ai Assistants
    * API Generation
