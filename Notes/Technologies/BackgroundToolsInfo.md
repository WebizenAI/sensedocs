# Background Re: Tools


In-order to understand what's going on here, there's a bunch of tools that are useful to be aware of generally.  Whilst i'm not necessarily an expert user of any of them (nor is it necessarily the case that i'm not); its an important starting point to at least be aware of these tools; and ideally also, having tried some of them out.

## ProLog

[Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) is a high-level computer programming language first [devised](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU904AU904&sxsrf=AJOqlzVLmPres8fRzQkTvCIWZkfV3ZCCfQ:1675935070359&q=devised&si=AEcPFx5hn0gxdHqlMdkaq7LnvtdUMcBpcDdA9XZfPag9zkwhND7CWX3awXsIaSd5R9UaiXoC0KwbprcdLE77A8Jt5iceQ18v9w%3D%3D&expnd=1) for artificial intelligence applications, that first appeared over 50 years ago.

The most popular software package for prolog is:  https://www.swi-prolog.org/ 

There is also a GoLang prolog project here: https://github.com/ichiban/prolog

## OWL based Ontology Modellers.

[OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) is a specified ontology that also provides specified reasoning extensions.  OWL based or related ontology editors include, but are not limited to some as are illustrated below.

### Protege

Description by WikiPedia:

The Protégé meta-tool was first built by Mark Musen in 1987 and has since been developed by a team at Stanford University. The software is the most popular and widely used ontology editor in the world.

#### Fluent Editor

_Fluent Editor_ is an ontology _editor_ tool produced by [cognitum](https://www.cognitum.eu/), for _editing_ complex ontologies that uses Natural Language, compatible with Semantic Web standard.  It is interoperable with Protege.

## Semantic Web Stuff (inc. Triple / Quad Stores)

It is kinda important to have at least some comprehension of the existance and scope of the existing 'semantic web' implementation that is now operational today.  To get there, it might be helpful to start by having a look / investigation - into some of the tools, 

There's a list: https://www.w3.org/wiki/LargeTripleStores 
some more info: https://github.com/semantalytics/awesome-semantic-web

Openlink Virtuoso: https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/ is well known..

#### RDF / Sparql Star

Note: there's a significant update being developed that is generally defined as RDF-Star or Sparql-Star; info is available, https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec

## AI tools & Other.

There's alot.  You'll find a bunch of papers and related information in this library of [Data Science](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18kpYSPz4yQMMn0IOfaPT7JyYD1wXEGMn) resources.

i'll add more as i get there. . .
