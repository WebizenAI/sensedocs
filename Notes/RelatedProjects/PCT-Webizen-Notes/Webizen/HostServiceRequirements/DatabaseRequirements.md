# Database Requirements

These documents may be out of sync with the folder considering the same problems via the [Webizen DevDocs DatabaseRequirements](https://devdocs.webizen.org/WebizenTechStack/EngineeringConsiderations/DatabaseRequirements/) page. 

The design requirements for the Webizen Ecosystems seek to require a Database solution that supports [[Sparql]].  the closest that solution that has been found so far is [[BQL]] as is provided via [[BadWolf]].

Whilst not considered optimal, [[GraphQL]] is also required due to the wide-spread use of it. 

The primary data-storage method will be based upon the use of [[SemanticWeb]] technology ecosystem parts; whilst making use of them in ways that are undocumented and/or different (ie: [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]] ).
