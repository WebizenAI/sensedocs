## What is Webizen?

### Introduction

[Webizen](https://github.com/linkeddata/webizen) 1.0 was a Search Engine. The project, alongside many other related projects were deprecated.  Some of the Resources were protected some time ago and now; redefined...

## The New Webizen
Webizen is Independent to the project known as Solid (formerally [#rww](https://www.w3.org/community/rww/)) as run by [inrupt](https://www.inrupt.com). 

The technology stack being produced as [Webizen 3.0](https://devdocs.webizen.org/WebizenTechStack/Webizen3.0/) requires the development of  [[PermissiveCommonsTech]]. 

(As is illustrated in the image / diagram below)

The 'Webizen Agent' requires both; a means to support the distribution, storage and use of information that is relied upon by more than one person (a 'commons') as well as a means to privately store and operate their own personal information.  

A great deal of the underlying historical work related to and intended to employ derivatives that were produce via the #RWW & #CrossCloud related projects; which is in-turn what the name #Webizen is intended to pay tribute to, whilst likely to have a different sort of approach than has otherwise been demonstrated by #Solid.

### What does Webizen Mean?

When Asking #ChatGPT to define the Term Webizen; it says,

>A webizen is a term used to describe an individual who is actively involved in online communities and who is an active and engaged citizen of the internet. Webizens are often thought of as being proactive and responsible users of the internet, who contribute to online communities in positive ways and help to create a sense of community and connection online.
>
>Webizens may be involved in a variety of online activities, such as participating in forums or discussion groups, creating content or media, or engaging with others on social media. They may also be involved in advocacy efforts related to internet governance or online rights and freedoms.
>
>Overall, the term webizen is used to describe individuals who are actively involved in online communities and who are committed to being responsible and engaged citizens of the internet.

Whereas; when i consider the term 'Webizen', what i'm thinking about is future [Artificial Minds](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/WebScience/ArtificialMinds/) that are owned by human beings to be their assistant and support their needs. 

The [[PCT-WebizenTechStack]] is in-effect, the creation of an ecosystem solution that provides support for [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI]] as is instrumental for [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] systems.

### About Webizen Systems
As this documentation environment presents; The webizen systems, are designed in a particular way to support a particular type of ecosystem outcome that considers both a variety of technology related factors and requirements, in addition to various social factors and related considerations and implications.

These systems become assembled to provide a different type of Computing Environment, which in-turn provide the opportunity to produce different types of Apps, that have different types of capabilities, functionality and features. 

There are a series of principals relating to structure of these designs.  In-turn, the outcome is far greater than the sum of its parts...  In-effect, the environment provides a different sort of toolkit or apparatus, that is intended to support safety and the safe use of democratised [[WebScience/PeaceInfrastructureProject/SafetyProtocols/HumanCentricAI]].   The way this is emboided for social purposes, is that the environment produces an ecosystem solution to support a particular class of  that are in-turn what it is that the meaning of webizen is intended to define, in future. 

### The Future Webizen Agents

![[WebizenPeaceBot.png]]

The Future Webizen Agents, are a type or class of Artificial Intelligent Agent that have a series of particular qualities; and importantly also, an array of [[SafetyProtocols]] that works effectively to ensure that other forms of Artificial Minds are not able to both be called or be made able to work on the [[PCT-WebizenTechStack]] and still be compliant with [[TheWebizenCharter]].

### Digital Twins vs. Webizen

For a very long time, the work on forming a 'knowledge banking' (previously called an 'information bank' or 'ibank'); developed in a way where the advent of the term 'digital twin' was adopted in an effort to try to describe the role of an 'inforg' and in-turn the AI extension of a natural person, and the importance of seeking to ensure the ontological design and related social fabric issues were created in a way that could reasonably support Human Dignity.  But this method effectively failed.  The Strength of 'competition' from actors who sought to 'own' people digitally, via their 'digital twin' and related ecosystems, was so strong; and there was a complete lack of viable support for works to produce alternatives.  Further to these issues, when getting stuck into the fields of science of consciousness, the debates that were brought about were almost religious in nature.  Then, there were also technologists (many whom i admire) who were talking about AI being like a human; which, when bonded to the exhibits of how these technologies were being commercialised, led me to fear the implications.   So, these circumstances; which indeed also, i note the volume of remarkable minds who have provided support for me to be engendered with a basis to form insights,

Led me to realise, that there was a pivotal shift that could or moreover should occur. 

What i needed to do, was to form a means to communicate and support the social development of works (on the [[SocialFactors]] ) by refocusing the work via a lens that was focused on seeking to get people to think about what sorts of  [Artificial Minds](https://devdocs.webizen.org/SocialFactors/WebScience/ArtificialMinds/) it is that they actually want to create.
