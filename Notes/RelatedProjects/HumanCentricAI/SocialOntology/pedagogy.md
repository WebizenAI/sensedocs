**Pedagogy** ([/ˈpɛdəɡɒdʒi, -ɡoʊdʒi, -ɡɒɡi/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")), most commonly understood as the approach to [teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching "Teaching"), is the theory and practice of [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning "Learning"), and how this process influences, and is influenced by, the social, political and [psychological development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology "Developmental psychology") of learners. Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place during learning. Both the theory and practice of pedagogy vary greatly as they reflect different social, political, and cultural contexts.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy#cite_note-1)
