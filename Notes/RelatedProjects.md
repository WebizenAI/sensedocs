The related projects folder, is where i've put information about projects that relate to the useful purpose of undertaking this project; as to employ it, for use with other systems, both, those that i'm working on, and those that others may also end-up using sense to support.

**Economic Systems:** is extracted from the webizen works, which refers to a project that seeks to implement an ecosystem that supports a concept centered around support for the natural agent; via personal, human centric AI agents.  This is then curated in a way that is highly dependent upon the use of ontologies, that then in-turn seeks to rationalise socio-economic relations. 

**Peace Infrastructure Projec**t - is the highest level project objective, that is considered to require an array of tools / apparatus, in-order to be better equipped to undertake further parts of this project as to have far broader effect upon the status of our human family and natural environment at large. 

**PCT-Webizen-Notes** is about Permissive Commons Technology and in-turn also Webizen.  The Sense project, has been seperated from the permissive commons technology documentation; which depends upon the useful dervivatives of sense, as does webizen. 

**HumanCentricAI** incorporates notes about SocialOntology, that is seeking to consider some of the social factors, and therein; how to represent and/or consider them via systems; and in-turn also personal ontology, the values project, considerations about the science of consciousness whiuch thereby incorporates an array of complex considerations associated to quantum informatics.
