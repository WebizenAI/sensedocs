https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/02/difference-between-utf-8-utf-16-and-utf.html

put simply, it appears the ability to encode any form of character requires UTF-32.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Unicode_encodings
RDF is in UTF-8 

UTF-8 is between 1-4 bytes, UTF-32 is 4 bytes fixed.

https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text/encoding/unicode/utf32 
Please note that support for UTF-32 is discouraged as it is a rare and inefficient encoding, unfit for use as an interchange format. For use on the web, the W3C strongly discourages its use ([https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#charset](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#charset)) while WHATWG directly prohibits supporting it ([https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#character-encodings](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#character-encodings)).
