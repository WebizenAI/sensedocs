As an extension to the [[AChatGPTExperimentHolborn]] i'm interested in using holborn as an example to support the investigation into the spatio-temporal requirements to understand the meaning of a word.  

I understand this is - well, about my surname - and perhaps the method can be employed by others to look to do similar activities with respect to their own; but the underlying benefit, is that it provides a simplified use-case, that can in-turn be used to get through complexity.

I'll make notes - and slowly update it.  noting - the chatGPT notes also provides some insight about the implication of gpt like large language model issues...  although, there are many examples...

### Old Email to my brother & father

below is a copy/paste of most of an email sent to family a few years back, as i did some research that led to getting a bit distracted and learning more than i was aware of earlier. 
  
"The name Holborn appears Norse in origin" meaning - "hill fort"  source: [https://enschrage.nl/lh/main/main_nc/holborn_head.html](https://enschrage.nl/lh/main/main_nc/holborn_head.html)  
  **Holborn Head** is a headland at the north of the Highland aera of Scotland at the Atlantic coast of Caithness. The name Holborn appears Norse in origin. The first part of the name Holl, means a hill while the last part is probably from borg, the Hill fort. The lighthouse does not actually stand on Holborn Head itself, but is located about 1 km south of the said hill on Little Holborn Head, on the north side of Scrabster and west of Thurso Bay. It is easily seen from Thurso.

  
The **NAME** 'holborn' appears to resolve to post William the conquer, the deal that was set-out with present-day 'city of London' and establishment of Westminster; and thereafter, a census that occurred, where history suggests [https://opendomesday.org/place/TQ3181/holborn/](https://opendomesday.org/place/TQ3181/holborn/) is where the meaning of the name comes.  However i'm not sure this intepretation is reasonably correct, noting in particular "The City was not covered by the [Domesday Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book "Domesday Book")." (source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London#Medieval_era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London#Medieval_era) ).  Now thereafter, here's a few more insights i've come across in my research.
 
if you look [https://www.britannica.com/place/London/History](https://www.britannica.com/place/London/History) - most people lived within the city walls, which was the territory that was successfully defended, resolving to consequences in our international world through to present day.  Yet not all people lived within the walls, and there was a process involved in getting approval to enter, etc.

Some centuries later, The first (post-roman) legal quarter were placed in Holborn (outside of the somewhat sovereignly governed city of london, noting its present day 'livery companies' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_company) and related governance differentiators that seemingly correspond to the latin meaning of the word 'corporation' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History) ).  [https://www.camden.gov.uk/camdens-history](https://www.camden.gov.uk/camdens-history) 

Few relational points i found interesting
 
The templars (city of london, noting the crest) were intrinsically involved with londonium, later migrating to Switzerland and elsewhere (ie: scotland); whilst the freemasonry related infrastructure appears to have something to do with the post-templar transition: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Freemasonry#Origin_myths_and_theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Freemasonry#Origin_myths_and_theories) alongside the resolution of the magna carta, at a time that also corresponds to a 100 year war, and the issue that templars (amongst others, i think) didn't go to war in a way that was desirable (they only went on 100 day tours of duty), as such mercenaries were required. 
  
Therein - an underlying considerations are, that holborn is the highest local point [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Holborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Holborn) and it seems reasonable to consider that this is likely a good place to have a defence related outpost for westminister - but perhaps prior to that - londinium [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Londinium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Londinium) . 
  
There are notes about a roman highway in relation to holborn and therein - considerations are now speculated about the meaning of this place name, as our surname, and perhaps some related considerations that seemingly make more sense than the suggestion that its spelt differently, and has 2 inhabitants (as noted in the domesday book, although that may well have been a post-war outcome) - may alternatively be interpreted by the meaning that may be inscribed for a purpose that excluded the city of london, whereby the name 'holborn' may have later emerged - but that, its hard to find other details...  i'm not sure. 

What appears more likely is that there were 'things' / people, buildings, etc more than what is listed in the doomsday book; that is not in it, because it was part of londinium. 

I was surprised about the results of my studies, given the historical stories being about the name being originally spelt differently, with a different meaning.  
  
noting - i was moreover working on global knowledge banking infrastructure solutions, and the discoveries relating to this are moreover incidental.  Nonetheless, when considering other studies with respect to epigenetics, i do find it interesting that pembroke st is on top of a hill, amongst the many thoughts...    
  
moreover, leaving me with a sense-making consideration that rather than considering holborn to relate moreover to other form of spelling that may relate to a river - it's seemingly reasonable to consider, that its heritage has more to do with the place, and type of activity undertaken by the people in a place called holborn.  There's a number of 'realities' that make this consideration seem logical, although i'm yet to find alot of evidence to support it.  one idea, was that perhaps if there was conflict with respect to the templars, history became largely re:written  
  
Perhaps also,  another intepretation is that the name came-about as a consequence of the scot's. Yet, there doesn't seem to be much evidence about the area being used for purposes that may relate to the concept of a 'hill fort',  and moreover, what appears to provide a little more sense-making, is the symbology encoded (ie: [https://www.heraldryandcrests.com/pages/heraldic-symbolism-a-z](https://www.heraldryandcrests.com/pages/heraldic-symbolism-a-z) )  into the various coat of arms [https://www.google.com/search?q=Holborn+coat+of+arms&tbm=isch](https://www.google.com/search?q=Holborn+coat+of+arms&tbm=isch)  and city of london markers ( [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:City_of_London_marker,_High_Holborn_WC2_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1318996.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:City_of_London_marker,_High_Holborn_WC2_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1318996.jpg) ) , that seemingly need to be interpreted in association to other pieces of information about the history of the time; noting in particular, that the deal forged with the city of london, when westminster was established - was that the sovereign rule of the king (or queen) was to be recognised;  this is somewhat seperate to the history of the bank of england, and the sorts of things its said to have played a role in,

The point to my mail is to provide a few points to illustrate a conceptual framework, that seems to suggest an alternative version of provenance for the specific term 'holborn',  whilst the somewhat singular reference [https://enschrage.nl/lh/main/main_nc/holborn_head.html](https://enschrage.nl/lh/main/main_nc/holborn_head.html) - would ideally be supplemented with what may be a varied research pattern, given the historical differences illustrated by the reference found through a process of doing another form of research; relating to my work on an 'information banking' or now moreover 'knowledge banking' thing, leading to this interesting historically considered discovery.

Therein another discovery i found was: [https://zigbeedomotica.nl/holborn_computers/](https://zigbeedomotica.nl/holborn_computers/)  - but that's now a somewhat different sort of ancient history...   

The heritage of important women dating back through this timeline, is ever so much more difficult to even fathom how to do today.  Perhaps when this 'web of data' stuff gets going overtime, future generations will find it easier to do, much as is the case today by comparison to my elders...  I remember Poppa with stories and books, but honestly - the memory is vague, and our means to do research today is entirely different.  

Personally, rather than 'hole' 'born' or some other set of memories that i continue to remember to be derogatory in nature - i entirely love the idea of a bunch of templar knights in a 'hill fort', as a means to describe where a bunch of people who ended-up with a surname 'holborn' came from.  ;)
