This folder is going to be the place where i put notes about the philophical, social-sciences and related considerations associated to the design process; as well as, links to research. 

### About folder structure contents

The folder contains some content that is written for this documetation project itself, and other content that is shared and/or from other related project documentation elsewhere. 

Its presently somewhat disorganised, and certainly also incomplete. 

The general objective is to provide some of the ingredents considered important to consider and comprehend some of the intended applications, that then in-turn feed into the design considerations.  

ABOUT;  is about the general gist of 'web science' as is applied in this context... 



**Information Theory** works, seeks to refer to specific concepts that associate with information theory specifically - in ration to computational and systems related theory - ie: nomenclature.

**Observer** folder, is about consciousness / the 'status of the observer', and considerations about the natural agent specifically.
