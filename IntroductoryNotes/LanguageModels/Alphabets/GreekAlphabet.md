The **Greek alphabet** has been used to write the [Greek language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") since the late 9th or early 8th century BCE.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#cite_note-FOOTNOTECook19879-4) It is derived from the earlier [Phoenician alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet "Phoenician alphabet"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#cite_note-5) and was the earliest known [alphabetic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabetic_script "Alphabetic script") to have distinct letters for [vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowels "Vowels") as well as [consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonants "Consonants"). In [Archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Greece "Archaic Greece") and early [Classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece "Classical Greece") times, the Greek alphabet existed in [many local variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Greek_alphabets "Archaic Greek alphabets"), but, by the end of the 4th century BCE, the [Euclidean alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_alphabet "Euclidean alphabet"), with 24 letters, ordered from [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha "Alpha") to [omega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega "Omega"), had become standard and it is this version that is still used for Greek writing today.
