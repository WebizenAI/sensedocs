# Indigenous Languages

I was told recently, that there is no local indigienous version of 'peace be with you', the man told me that the closest thing; was two words or phrases, one had the meaning of 'learn to be brothers' and the other had the meaning of 'learn to be honest'... 

The knowledge culture of Australia's indigenous people, is remarkable...  but poorly considered generally.  Fundamentally, there were no books; there were songlines, but no books.  The system is very different, and its something to be thoughtful of for future betterment of one another.  It is thought likely that similar, enriching insights may be gained from many.
