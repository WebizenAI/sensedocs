**Cyc** (pronounced [/ˈsaɪk/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [_SYKE_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) is a long-term [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") project that aims to assemble a comprehensive [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science) "Ontology (information science)") and [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base "Knowledge base") that spans the basic concepts and rules about how the world works. Hoping to capture [common sense knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense_knowledge "Common sense knowledge"), Cyc focuses on [implicit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_knowledge "Implicit knowledge") that other AI platforms may take for granted. This is contrasted with facts one might find somewhere on the internet or retrieve via a search engine or Wikipedia. Cyc enables [semantic reasoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_reasoner "Semantic reasoner") to perform human-like reasoning and be less "brittle" when confronted with novel situations.
