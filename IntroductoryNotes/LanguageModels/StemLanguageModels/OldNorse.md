# Old Norse

**Old Norse**, **Old Nordic**,[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse#cite_note-2) or **Old Scandinavian**, is a stage of development of [North Germanic dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Germanic_languages "North Germanic languages") before their final divergence into separate Nordic languages. Old Norse was spoken by inhabitants of [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia") and their [overseas settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_expansion "Viking expansion") and chronologically coincides with the [Viking Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age"), the [Christianization of Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization_of_Scandinavia "Christianization of Scandinavia") and the consolidation of Scandinavian kingdoms from about the 7th to the 15th centuries.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse#cite_note-3)
