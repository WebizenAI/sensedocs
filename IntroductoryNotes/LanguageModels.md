# Language Models

This Folder Contains information about languages and in-turn also, the existing language models.

NoteAlso; folder on [[Alphabets]]

There's some placeholders; and a whole bunch of room for improvement... (its entirely incomplete).  Added to the language models folder, is also some notes about computer based [[LargeLanguageModels]], some thoughts about [[StemLanguageModels]] and perhaps importantly also - [[Alphabets]] (although i'm not entirely sure where to put [[Heraldry]]).

Whilst these resources are indeed incomplete.   The practice is opening up my view on the difference between a language and knowledge model.  I'm starting to see the issue of seeking to restrict a model to simply the words; without ending-up with a far more comprehensive process of, in-effect, starting the PermissiveCommons tech process; more expansively, than was otherwise considered earlier.  Whilst the goals remain the same; perhaps the method needs to be adapted to ensure the focus remains, making best efforts.
