# Interfaces

Sense should have an authentication interface; that allows it to be employed in a variety of contexts.  Interfaces are expected to be packaged into the libraries for other applications that are most likely to be written in Python, GoLang (or JS / NodeJS).

Sense should be have compatible input / output interfaces for the following types / data-structure.

- JSON API
- GraphQL
- RDF-Star / Sparql-Star
- RDF / Sparql 1.1  
- Command line interface.  

## Output Modals.

The modelling should support declarative and procedural semantics; in addition to inferencing and probability modals.  The model should be designed to provide a (RDF Structured) metadata report that explains information about the content.  This may include the generation of information about how an answer was derived, it may also include information about the context of the information in the content.
