This Note is about Sparql-MM.

### Background & Related Links
Sparql-MM was produced as part of the [Mico-Project](www.mico-project.eu) which i've always been a fan of... However, my older 'knowledge banking' works, didn't really care about enterprise java platforms anywhere near as much as is now the case with solutions that are more focused on solutions that are less reliant upon enterprise / governments... 

The mico-project had a bunch of extractors:

## Considerations.

We will want to form a decentralised pipeline for processing image data, particularly in relation to [[Heraldry]] and [[Alphabets]], whilst not exclusively.  

The Permissive commons systems overtime are intended to form far more sophistocated and advanced employment of these models  / modals; in ways that are intended to support human dignity, which in-turn requires rules, etc. 

Whilst the webizen ecosystem defines a set of rules via 'safety protocols', they're not clearly defined in an implementation yet; as such, caution should be employed about this process, whilst also seeking to intentionally produce software that has the express purpose of being deployed in a manner that is designed to support those safety protocols.
