Sense needs to be multi-modal.  There is a virtually limitless number of 'allowed' permutations, however some will be more useful than others. 

The systems need to support an array of functionality that supports the ability to recgonise and process various social factors that are implicity associated to the management and maintainence of the sense infrastructure.

### Social Vs. Personal Context.

The operation of the model should support the private and personal use of the software; and independently also, the social use and support for protocols that share information that can be used to continually update and adapt the model.

The local sense runtime MUST operate privately; whilst the runtime service is intended to support the function of other apps, it is not intended to unnecessarily or unwantedly support pervasive survellience in any secret or undeclared manner.   There are nuances, which will be canvased elsewhere in the docs.  

### modifications, etc. 

There are people who've studied language and related fields, for their entire lives; whilst also, as is demonstrated over recent years, at times these 'professors' and/or societally trusted experts can and do make false statements; which is entirely up to them, yet, all persons should be subject to accountability systems; which may in-turn have more impact upon persons within a field of expertise of this kind, who subsequently ends-up with a track-record of providing unreliable information to a cohort or classification of persons (ie; the public).

As i am reinforceable stating; this is not intended to be a 'knowledge model' about the world at large; rather, it is expressly seeking to be restricted to the meaning of words, phrases, vocabulary - the spoken and written languages used by persons in the context of 'english'; and in-turn thereafter also, other languages. 

This will in-turn require the means to process information relating to the historical context through which terms / words, are defined.  

Thereafter also; there is also, generally - hoped - to be a difference between the definitions provided by a cohort of professional experts in a particular field, that should be more trust-worthy than some definition of the same term provided by a lay person; notwithstanding, the difficulty in comprehending which is which. 

if PEOPLE want to use language in a particular way; that is otherwise considered 'wrong' then, so long as that's able to be explained in the documents generated via the system; there is not an express problem from a systems perspective of seeking to ensure they're able to do so.  

It just needs to be properly defined.

These definitions are in-turn associated with both geospatial and temporal informatics.  A recent example is the nature though which the definition of 'vaccine' has been changed and forcibly applied in ways that would greatly benefit through the effective use of ontology.
