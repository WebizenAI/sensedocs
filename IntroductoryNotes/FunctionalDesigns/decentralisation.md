# Decentralisation

Sense must be a decentralised application that works in a decentralised manner across the network.  The way in which it is decentralised, should support the means to at least log (if not more) the amount of energy and resources consumed by any peer to support the development and maintainence of sense; as is in-turn attributed to whatever they contributed towards creating, maintaining, improving, etc.
