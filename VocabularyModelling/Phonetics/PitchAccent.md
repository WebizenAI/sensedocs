A **pitch-accent language**, when spoken, has word [accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accentuation "Accentuation") in which one [syllable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable "Syllable") in a word or [morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme "Morpheme") is more prominent than the others, but the accentuated syllable is indicated by a contrasting [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music) "Pitch (music)") ([linguistic tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics) "Tone (linguistics)")) rather than by loudness (or length), as in many languages, like English. Pitch-accent also contrasts with fully [tonal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonal_languages "Tonal languages") like [Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language "Vietnamese language") and [Standard Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese "Standard Chinese"), in which each syllable can have an independent tone. Some have claimed that the term "pitch accent" is not coherently defined and that pitch-accent languages are just a sub-category of tonal languages in general.
