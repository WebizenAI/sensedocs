In [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), **intonation** is variation in [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music) "Pitch (music)") used to indicate the speaker's attitudes and emotions, to highlight or [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(linguistics) "Focus (linguistics)") an expression, to signal the [illocutionary act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illocutionary_act "Illocutionary act") performed by a sentence, or to regulate the flow of [discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse "Discourse"). For example, the [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") question "Does Maria speak Spanish or French?" is interpreted as a [yes-or-no question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes-or-no_question "Yes-or-no question") when it is uttered with a single rising intonation contour, but is interpreted as an [alternative question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_question "Alternative question") when uttered with a rising contour on "Spanish" and a falling contour on "French". Although intonation is primarily a matter of pitch variation, its effects almost always work hand-in-hand with other [prosodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics) "Prosody (linguistics)") features. Intonation is distinct from [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics) "Tone (linguistics)"), the phenomenon where pitch is used to distinguish words (as in [Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese "Mandarin Chinese")) or to mark grammatical features (as in [Kinyarwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinyarwanda "Kinyarwanda")).
