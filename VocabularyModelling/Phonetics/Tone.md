**Tone** is the use of [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music) "Pitch (music)") in [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language") to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning – that is, to distinguish or to [inflect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection "Inflection") words.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEYip20021%E2%80%933,_17%E2%80%9318-1) All verbal languages use pitch to express emotional and other paralinguistic information and to convey emphasis, contrast and other such features in what is called [intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonation_(linguistics) "Intonation (linguistics)"), but not all languages use tones to distinguish words or their inflections, analogously to consonants and vowels. Languages that have this feature are called **tonal languages**; the distinctive tone patterns of such a language are sometimes called **tonemes**,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)#cite_note-2) by analogy with _[phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme "Phoneme")_. Tonal languages are common in East and Southeast Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Pacific.
