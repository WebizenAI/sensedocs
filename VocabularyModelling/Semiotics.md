**Semiotics** (also called **semiotic studies**) is the systematic study of sign processes ([semiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiosis "Semiosis")) and meaning making. Semiosis is any activity, conduct, or process that involves [signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics) "Sign (semiotics)"), where a sign is defined as anything that communicates something, usually called a [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(semiotics) "Meaning (semiotics)"), to the sign's interpreter. The meaning can be intentional, such as a word uttered with a specific meaning; or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can also communicate feelings (which are usually not considered meanings) and may communicate internally (through thought itself) or through any of the senses: [visual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system "Visual system"), [auditory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing "Hearing"), [tactile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system "Somatosensory system"), [olfactory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction "Olfaction"), or [gustatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste "Taste") (taste). Contemporary semiotics is a branch of science that studies meaning-making and various types of knowledge.
