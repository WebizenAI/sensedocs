A **neologism** ([/niːˈɒlədʒɪzəm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")) (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") νέο- _néo_(="new") and λόγος /_lógos_, meaning "speech, utterance") is a relatively recent or isolated term, word, or phrase that may be in the process of entering common use, but that has not been fully accepted into mainstream language.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-1) Neologisms are often driven by changes in culture and technology.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-2)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-3) In the process of [language formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language "Origin of language"), neologisms are more mature than _[protologisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protologism "Protologism")_.[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-4) A word whose development stage is between that of the protologism (freshly coined) and neologism (new word) is a _prelogism_.[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism#cite_note-5)
