## Mathematics Ontology

The use of these works, whilst sought to be designed to support Human Centric principals (including Human Centric AI principals); will end-up being processed by a software agent (on a computer).  Perhaps therefore defining in the 'upper ontology' mathematics may in-turn improve support for 'comprehensible sense making' or in otherwords, inferencing, etc.
