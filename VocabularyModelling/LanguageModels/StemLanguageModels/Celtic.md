# Celtic Languages

The **Celtic languages** ([usually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_of_Celtic "Pronunciation of Celtic") [/ˈkɛltɪk/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"), but sometimes [/ˈsɛltɪk/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")) are a [group of related languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_family "Language family") descended from [Proto-Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Celtic_language "Proto-Celtic language"). They form a branch of the [Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages "Indo-European languages") language family.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages#cite_note-1) The term "Celtic" was first used to describe this language group by [Edward Lhuyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lhuyd "Edward Lhuyd") in 1707,[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages#cite_note-2) following [Paul-Yves Pezron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul-Yves_Pezron "Paul-Yves Pezron"), who made the explicit link between the [Celts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts "Celts") described by classical writers and the [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language "Welsh language") and [Breton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_language "Breton language") languages.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages#cite_note-3)
During the 1st millennium BC, Celtic languages were spoken across much of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") and central [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia"). Today, they are restricted to the northwestern fringe of Europe and [a few diaspora communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_diaspora_(disambiguation) "Celtic diaspora (disambiguation)"). There are six living languages: the four continuously living languages [Breton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_language "Breton language"), [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language "Irish language"), [Scottish Gaelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic "Scottish Gaelic") and [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language "Welsh language"), and the two [revived languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revived_language "Revived language") [Cornish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_language "Cornish language") and [Manx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_language "Manx language"). All are minority languages in their respective countries, though there are continuing efforts at [revitalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_revitalization "Language revitalization"). Welsh is an official language in [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales "Wales") and Irish is an official language of [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "Ireland") and of the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"). Welsh is the only Celtic language not classified as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_language "Endangered language") by [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO"). The Cornish and Manx languages went extinct in modern times. They have been the object of revivals and now each has several hundred second-language speakers.
