**Phonetics** is a branch of [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics") that studies how humans produce and perceive sounds, or in the case of [sign languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language "Sign language"), the equivalent aspects of sign.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Grady200515-1) Linguists who specialize in studying the physical properties of speech are **phoneticians**. The field of phonetics is traditionally divided into three sub-disciplines based on the research questions involved such as how humans plan and execute movements to produce speech ([articulatory phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics "Articulatory phonetics")), how various movements affect the properties of the resulting sound ([acoustic phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_phonetics "Acoustic phonetics")), or how humans convert sound waves to linguistic information ([auditory phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_phonetics "Auditory phonetics")). Traditionally, the minimal linguistic unit of phonetics is the [phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_(phonetics) "Phone (phonetics)")—a speech sound in a language which differs from the phonological unit of [phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme "Phoneme"); the phoneme is an abstract categorization of phones, and it is also defined as the smallest unit that discerns meaning between sounds in any given language.
