Thinking in abstractions is considered by [anthropologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropologist "Anthropologist"), [archaeologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeologist "Archaeologist"), and [sociologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist "Sociologist") to be one of the key traits in [modern human behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_human_behaviour "Modern human behaviour"), which is believed to have developed between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. Its development is likely to have been closely connected with the development of human [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"), which (whether spoken or written) appears to both involve and facilitate abstract thinking.
