The term **dialect** (from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") _[dialectus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dialectus#Latin "wikt:dialectus")_, _[dialectos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dialectos#Latin "wikt:dialectos")_, from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") word [διάλεκτος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:διάλεκτος"), _diálektos_ 'discourse', from [διά](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC#Ancient_Greek "wikt:διά"), _diá_ 'through' and [λέγω](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%AD%CE%B3%CF%89#Ancient_Greek "wikt:λέγω"), _légō_ 'I speak') can refer to either of two distinctly different types of [linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics") phenomena:

One usage refers to a [variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics) "Variety (linguistics)") of a [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language") that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect#cite_note-1) Under this definition, the dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely [mutually intelligible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility "Mutual intelligibility"), especially if close to one another on the [dialect continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum "Dialect continuum"). The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as [social class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class "Social class") or [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity "Ethnicity").[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect#cite_note-auto9-2) A dialect that is associated with a particular [social class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class "Social class") can be termed a [sociolect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociolect "Sociolect"), a dialect that is associated with a particular [ethnic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group "Ethnic group") can be termed an [ethnolect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnolect "Ethnolect"), and a geographical/regional dialect may be termed a regiolect[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect#cite_note-auto1-3) (alternative terms include 'regionalect',[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect#cite_note-auto2-4) 'geolect',[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect#cite_note-auto6-5) and 'topolect'[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect#cite_note-auto10-6)). According to this definition, any variety of a given language can be classified as a "dialect", including any [standardized varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_language "Standard language"). In this case, the distinction between the "standard language" (i.e. the "standard" dialect of a particular language) and the "[nonstandard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_dialect "Nonstandard dialect")" (vernacular) dialects of the same language is often [arbitrary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary "Arbitrary") and based on social, political, cultural, or historical considerations or prevalence and prominence.[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect#cite_note-chao-7)[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect#cite_note-Lyons-8)[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect#cite_note-johnson-9) In a similar way, the definitions of the terms "language" and "dialect" may overlap and are often subject to debate, with the differentiation between the two classifications often grounded in arbitrary or sociopolitical motives.[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect#cite_note-mcworther-10) The term "dialect" is however sometimes restricted to mean "non-standard variety", particularly in non-specialist settings and non-English linguistic traditions.
